Question: In plants, the xylem and phloem move water and nutrients through the plant for use and storage. In humans, an organ system with a similar function is the

        "description": "The integumentary system protects the body, not involved in the internal transport of substances like the xylem and phloem."
    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "cardiovascular system.",
    "reasoning": "The xylem and phloem in plants function to transport water and nutrients throughout the plant, a role similar to that of the cardiovascular system in humans, which circulates blood and lymph to transport oxygen, nutrients, and other substances to various tissues."
