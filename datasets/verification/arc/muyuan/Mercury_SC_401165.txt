Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a wagon rolling down a hill",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, a wagon rolling down a hill best exemplifies mechanical energy because it directly involves the motion (kinetic energy) and position (potential energy) of an object, which are key aspects of mechanical energy."
