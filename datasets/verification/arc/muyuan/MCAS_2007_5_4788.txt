Model Answer: {
    "answer": "put the cans under an electromagnet",
    "reasoning": "By utilizing an electromagnet, the recycling center can efficiently separate the steel cans from the aluminum cans. This process leverages the magnetic properties of steel (being attracted to an electromagnet) contrasting with the non-magnetic properties of aluminum (not being attracted to an electromagnet). This method directly targets the inherent material characteristics of the cans, making it a highly effective sorting mechanism."
