Model Answer: {
    "answer": "120\u00b0C",
    "reasoning": "At '-10\u00b0C' water is likely to be in solid form (ice). At '20\u00b0C', water is in its liquid state under normal conditions. At '90\u00b0C', water is hot and may start to evaporate slowly but is not at its boiling point under normal atmospheric pressure, thus not most likely to be in vapor form. At '120\u00b0C', water is above its boiling point of 100\u00b0C (at 1 atmospheric pressure), making it most likely to be in vapor form, since it is enough for water to transition from liquid to gas phase."
