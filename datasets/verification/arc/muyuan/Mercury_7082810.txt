Model Answer: {
    "answer": "equal to the force of the ball.",
    "reasoning": "According to Newton's Third Law of Motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In this case, the downward force (gravitational force) exerted by the bowling ball on the table is countered with an equal and opposite force exerted by the table on the bowling ball. This interaction is what keeps the ball in equilibrium (not moving) on the table. Therefore, the force exerted by the table must be equal to the force of the ball."
