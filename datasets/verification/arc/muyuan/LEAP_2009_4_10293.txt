Model Answer: {
    "answer": "touching it",
    "reasoning": "Touching the soil allows Tanisha to feel the texture, which is a significant characteristic for identifying different soil types. The physical texture and qualities of soil (such as sand, silt, clay, loam) can be best discerned through touch, making it a more effective method over smelling, weighing, or measuring it in dimensions."
