Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a black sweater",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, a black sweater absorbs the most visible light energy due to its color and material properties. Black objects are known for their capability to absorb more light energy than objects of lighter colors, converting it into heat. Unlike clear glass that transmits light, snowballs and mirrors that reflect most light, a black sweater does not reflect or transmit much light but instead absorbs it. The underlying concept of 'Color and light absorption' explains that darker colors absorb more light, making the black sweater the object that would absorb the most visible light energy when placed in direct sunlight."
