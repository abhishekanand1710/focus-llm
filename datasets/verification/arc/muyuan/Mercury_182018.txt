    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "crystal size",
    "reasoning": "Crystal size in igneous rocks serves as an indicator of the cooling rate, with larger crystals typically indicating a slower cooling process. The relationships outlined show that the cooling rate directly affects crystal size, and it's this characteristic property among the options given that indicates an igneous rock cooled slowly. Therefore, 'crystal size' is the correct answer."
