Question: What is one way plants and animals are different?
Options: ['Plants do not need minerals, and animals do.', 'Plants produce their own food, and animals do not.', 'Plants do not produce oxygen, and animals do.', 'Plants need sunlight, and animals do not.']
Answer: Plants produce their own food, and animals do not.

    },

        "name": "Sunlight",
        "description": "The natural light of the sun, crucial for photosynthesis in plants and indirectly important for animals."

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Plants produce their own food, and animals do not.",
    "reasoning": "The key difference between plants and animals as outlined in the concepts and their relationships is that plants can produce their own food through the process of photosynthesis, which requires sunlight. In contrast, animals cannot produce their own food and instead rely on consuming other organisms. This distinction highlights the option 'Plants produce their own food, and animals do not.' as the correct answer."
