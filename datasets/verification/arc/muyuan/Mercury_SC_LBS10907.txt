    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "new",
    "reasoning": "A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth, blocking all or part of the Sun's light. This can only happen during the new moon phase when the Moon's side facing Earth is not illuminated by the Sun, allowing the Moon to be positioned directly in front of the Sun from Earth's perspective. Other phases like full, quarter, and crescent moons do not align the Moon and the Sun in such a way to permit a solar eclipse."
