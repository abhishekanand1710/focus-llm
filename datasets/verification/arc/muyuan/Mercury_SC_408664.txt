Model Answer: {
    "answer": "summer",
    "reasoning": "The plants in Ellie's garden would receive the most energy from the Sun for growing in summer. This is because summer is the warmest season of the year and receives the most sunlight, making it the most conducive period for photosynthesis and plant growth."
