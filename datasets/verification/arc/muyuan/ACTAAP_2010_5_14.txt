]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They release oxygen into the air.",
    "reasoning": "Green plants perform photosynthesis, where they convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using sunlight. This process contributes to the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle by releasing oxygen into the air, which is essential for the respiration of animals and humans. Therefore, among the given options, 'They release oxygen into the air' is the correct answer as it directly relates to the role of green plants in enhancing the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle."
