Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a squirrel storing nuts",
    "reasoning": "The squirrel storing nuts is directly preparing for a seasonal change, specifically for the winter, by gathering food to ensure survival during a period when food is scarce. This behavior is a direct preparation for the seasonal change, aligning with the concept of animals adapting to environmental changes, as opposed to the other options provided."
