Question: Scientists group animals based on physical features. Trout are classified as fish because of what physical feature?
Options: ['Fish have gills.', 'Fish eat the same food.', 'Fish live in the same area.', 'Fish have the same predators.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Fish have gills.",
    "reasoning": "Trout are classified as fish primarily because they possess gills, which is a distinctive physical feature enabling them to breathe underwater. This characteristic is crucial for their classification within the group of fish, as it directly relates to their respiratory system, which is a significant aspect of their biology and distinct from other animal groups."
