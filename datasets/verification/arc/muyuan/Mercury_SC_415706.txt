Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Wood",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, wood is the least likely to get hot when the spoon is placed in boiling water due to its poor conductivity and natural heat-resistance. Unlike metals like iron, which are good conductors of heat, wood does not conduct heat efficiently, making it the best choice for a heat-resistant handle. Ceramic, while also heat-resistant, may still transfer heat more than wood. Glass and iron, being more conductive, are not suitable choices for minimizing heat transfer in this context."
