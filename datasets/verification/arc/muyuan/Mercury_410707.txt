Question: Some nonnative plants can adapt to their environments more quickly than some native plants or crops can. Which adaptation would least likely help a nonnative plant to survive in a new environment?
Options: ['having a large number of seeds', 'having a resistance to herbicides', 'having roots that develop rapidly', 'having leaves that form at a slow rate']
Answer: having leaves that form at a slow rate

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "having leaves that form at a slow rate",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, having leaves that form at a slow rate would least likely help a nonnative plant to survive in a new environment. This is because fast leaf formation is crucial for photosynthesis, which in turn supports growth and energy production. Without quickly developing leaves, a plant may not be able to efficiently convert sunlight into the energy needed to grow, reproduce, and outcompete native species or adapt to new conditions. The other options, such as producing a large number of seeds, having resistance to herbicides, and having roots that develop rapidly, are direct adaptations that would enhance a plant's ability to spread, resist external threats, and establish itself in a new environment."
