Question: While on a field trip to NASA, Felicia saw a short film on materials that make up nebulae. Which topic was most likely presented in the film?
Options: ['asteroid development', 'stellar formation', 'planetary orbits', 'galaxy shapes']

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "stellar formation",
    "reasoning": "The film Felicia saw on the materials that make up nebulae is most likely about 'stellar formation,' as nebulae are massive clouds of gas and dust where new stars are born. This option directly relates to the aspects of nebulae involved in creating stars, aligning with the content of the film described."
