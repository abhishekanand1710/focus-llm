Question: The plate-tectonic model has achieved the status of a scientific theory due to which property of the model?
Options: ['It has been empirically proved to be true.', 'It has passed extensive, independent tests of its predictions.', 'It is clearer, simpler, and more plausible than other models.', 'It provides guidelines for Earth-science investigations that are scientifically valid.']
Answer: It has passed extensive, independent tests of its predictions.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It has passed extensive, independent tests of its predictions.",
    "reasoning": "The status of the plate-tectonic model as a scientific theory is primarily due to its ability to pass extensive, independent tests of its predictions. This criterion is directly related to how scientific theories are verified and accepted in the scientific community, highlighting the model's predictive power and the reproducibility of its findings across independent investigations. The other options, while relevant to the credibility and utility of the model, are not the primary criteria for achieving the status of a scientific theory."
