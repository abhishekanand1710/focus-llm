Model Answer: {
    "answer": "A lion cub practices its hunting skills.",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, the action most indicative of learned behavior is 'A lion cub practices its hunting skills.' This is because unlike nest building in birds, web spinning in spiders, or phototaxis in earthworms, which are examples of innate behaviors that the organisms are born with, lion cubs develop their hunting skills over time through observation and practice within their social group. This makes their hunting practice a learned behavior, as it is acquired through experience rather than being an inborn instinct."
