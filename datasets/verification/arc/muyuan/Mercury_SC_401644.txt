Model Answer: {
    "answer": "preferred food.",
    "reasoning": "The traits such as height, weight, and coat color are genetically inherited from the parents to their offspring, thus a baby horse would inherit these from its parents. Preferred food, however, is not a trait that is passed down genetically, but rather, is influenced by the horse's experiences and environment. Therefore, a baby horse does not inherit its preferred food from its parents."
