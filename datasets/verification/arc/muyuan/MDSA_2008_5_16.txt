    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "evaporation",
    "reasoning": "On a warm, sunny day, the heat increases the water's temperature, enhancing the evaporation process where water turns from liquid into vapor. This is consistent with the basic principles of how water reacts to warm conditions and sunlight exposure."
