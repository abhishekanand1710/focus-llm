Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The energy in the wood is transformed.",
    "reasoning": "When wood is completely burned in a fire, the chemical process transforms the stored chemical energy in the wood into other forms of energy, like heat and light, while producing combustion products. This transformation complies with the Conservation of Energy principle, stating that energy is neither created nor destroyed but transformed. It is not a reversible change since the wood cannot be returned to its original state after burning, and it represents a chemical change, not a physical one."
