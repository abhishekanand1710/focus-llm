Model Answer: {
    "answer": "to remove toxic material from the stomach before it is absorbed",
    "reasoning": "The main function of the vomiting reflex is to protect the body by expelling toxic substances from the stomach before they can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This is achieved by the reflex's ability to identify and respond to the presence of harmful substances in the stomach, thus preventing potential damage to the body by stopping their absorption."
