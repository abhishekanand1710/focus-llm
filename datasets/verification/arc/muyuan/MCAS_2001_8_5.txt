Model Answer: {
    "answer": "to store water and food for cells",
    "reasoning": "Based on the relationships and functions described, vacuoles primarily serve to store water and food for cells. This storage capacity helps in regulating the cell's internal environment and providing necessary resources for metabolism and growth, distinguishing it from the other functions related to energy release, cell membrane control, and cell protection which are not primary roles of vacuoles."
