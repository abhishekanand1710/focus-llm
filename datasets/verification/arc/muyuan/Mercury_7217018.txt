Model Answer: {
    "answer": "selective breeding.",
    "reasoning": "The process described involves intentionally cross-pollinating two tomato plants with desirable traits (virus resistance and large tomato production), which is a characteristic example of selective breeding. This is different from natural selection, which is an unguided, natural process; genetic engineering, which involves direct manipulation of DNA; and asexual reproduction, which involves only one parent and does not involve combining traits from two different plants."
