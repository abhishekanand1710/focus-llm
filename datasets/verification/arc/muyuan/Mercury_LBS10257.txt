Model Answer: {
    "answer": "6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} +6O_{2}",
    "reasoning": "This equation accurately represents the process of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) are utilized in the presence of light energy to produce glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). The described relationship between the inputs (carbon dioxide and water) and the outputs (glucose and oxygen) through photosynthesis supports this as the correct answer."
