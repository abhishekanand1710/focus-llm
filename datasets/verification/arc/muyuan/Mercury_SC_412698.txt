Model Answer: {
    "answer": "is a sign of a chemical change.",
    "reasoning": "The formation of gas bubbles when an effervescent tablet dissolves in water indicates a chemical change, as new substances (gas in this case) are produced. This process involves a chemical reaction between the substances in the tablet and water, different from physical properties or boiling, which do not involve the formation of new substances."
