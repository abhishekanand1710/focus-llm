Model Answer: {
    "answer": "determining where to cut the wood into pieces",
    "reasoning": "The tape measure is essential for accurately measuring the dimensions of wood before making cuts. This ensures that the pieces fit together properly in the construction of the doghouse. Unlike the other options, choosing the type of wood, removing extra nails, or attaching pieces together, determining where to cut the wood directly involves measurements for accuracy and fit, making the tape measure an indispensable tool in this context."
