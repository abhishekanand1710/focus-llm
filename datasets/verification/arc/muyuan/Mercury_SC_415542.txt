Model Answer: {
    "answer": "brick",
    "reasoning": "Based on the concepts and relationships identified, bricks typically have a greater mass than soccer balls, note pads, and quarters. Since mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and bricks are made of dense clay material, used in building due to their robustness, they inherently possess a greater mass compared to the other listed items that are designed to be lightweight or contain lesser material volume."
