Question: Kevin is observing the sky on a clear night. With the unaided eye he is able to see Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Why would Venus appear to be brighter than the other planets?
Options: ['It reflects the most sunlight toward Earth.', 'It is hotter than the other planets.', 'It is larger than the other planets.', 'It is closest planet to the Sun.']
Answer: It reflects the most sunlight toward Earth.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It reflects the most sunlight toward Earth.",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, Venus appears brighter than the other planets observed in a clear night sky primarily because it has a high ability to reflect sunlight back to Earth. This is due to its dense atmosphere, which is highly reflective, making it appear as the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon. The other options, such as its temperature, size, and proximity to the Sun, do not primarily contribute to its brightness as observed from Earth."
