    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "increased level of oxygen",
    "reasoning": "Early photosynthetic life forms, such as cyanobacteria, used photosynthesis to convert sunlight into chemical energy, which resulted in the production of oxygen as a byproduct. This process contributed to the increase in the level of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere, a significant change that allowed for the development and support of more diverse forms of life. The other options do not directly follow from the key process of photosynthesis carried out by early photosynthetic life."
