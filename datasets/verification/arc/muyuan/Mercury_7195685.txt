Question: Sea-floor spreading occurs at divergent boundaries. Which statement best identifies the geologic process taking place at the point where sea-floor spreading occurs?
Options: ['a trench is forming', 'new crust is forming', 'oceanic crust is subducting', 'a continental plate is subducting']
Answer: new crust is forming

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "new crust is forming",
    "reasoning": "Sea-floor spreading occurs at divergent boundaries, which are locations where tectonic plates are moving apart from each other. This process leads to the formation of new oceanic crust as molten material from the mantle reaches the Earth's surface and solidifies. Therefore, the correct option is that new crust is forming, aligning with the definition and outcome of sea-floor spreading."
