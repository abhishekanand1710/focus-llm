Answer: destroy habitat for many animal species.

        "description": "The building of a dam itself doesn't cause people to consume more water directly."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "destroy habitat for many animal species.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the identified concepts and their relationships, the construction of a dam typically results in habitat destruction. This process alters the natural environment considerably, leading to the destruction of the habitats that many animal species rely on for survival."
}
