Question: The water cycle describes the movement of the water of Earth. About 96% of the water of Earth is the salt water found in the oceans while the remaining 4% is fresh water. Where would the majority of the freshwater on Earth be found?
Options: ['groundwater and aquifers', 'swamps and wetlands', 'ice caps and glaciers', 'lakes and rivers']
Answer: ice caps and glaciers

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ice caps and glaciers",
    "reasoning": "Based on the identified concepts and their relationships, the majority of the Earth's freshwater is found in ice caps and glaciers. This is established through the relationship that fresh water's largest component is ice caps and glaciers, indicating that despite being only 4% of the Earth's total water, most of this fresh water is locked in ice formations in polar regions and high mountains."
