Question: Water used in a factory is heated to 75 degrees Celsius. It is discharged into a nearby river that has a normal temperature of 20 degrees Celsius. Which should most likely be done to minimize damage to the river?
Options: ['decrease the temperature of the factory water', 'increase the temperature of the river water', 'remove the vegetation from the river', 'add more fish to the river']
Answer: decrease the temperature of the factory water

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "decrease the temperature of the factory water",
    "reasoning": "Decreasing the temperature of the factory water before it is discharged into the river would minimize thermal pollution. This action protects the river ecosystem by maintaining water temperatures that are suitable for aquatic life and the health of the river vegetation. Thermal pollution, caused by releasing heated water into water bodies, can significantly impact aquatic life and destabilize ecosystems by altering temperatures beyond the species' tolerance levels. By cooling the factory discharge, the balance of the river can be better preserved, supporting the overall health and biodiversity of the area."
