Question: Which of the following has the least momentum?
Options: ['a 0.5 kg mass with a 1000 m/s velocity', 'a 1 kg mass with a 100 m/s velocity', 'a 10 kg mass with an 11 m/s velocity', 'a 100 kg mass with a 2 m/s velocity']
Answer: a 1 kg mass with a 100 m/s velocity

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a 100 kg mass with a 2 m/s velocity",
    "reasoning": "First, calculate the momentum for each option by multiplying the mass by its velocity. For a 0.5 kg mass with a 1000 m/s velocity, momentum = 0.5 * 1000 = 500 kg*m/s. For a 1 kg mass with a 100 m/s velocity, momentum = 1 * 100 = 100 kg*m/s. For a 10 kg mass with an 11 m/s velocity, momentum = 10 * 11 = 110 kg*m/s. For a 100 kg mass with a 2 m/s velocity, momentum = 100 * 2 = 200 kg*m/s. Comparing these values, the option 'a 100 kg mass with a 2 m/s velocity' has the least momentum among the given options."
