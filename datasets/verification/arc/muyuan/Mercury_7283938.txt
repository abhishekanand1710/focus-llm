Model Answer: {
    "answer": "coexistence",
    "reasoning": "Carolina wrens and painted buntings live in overlapping territories but have different requirements for food and nesting, indicating they do not harm each other nor depend on each other for benefits. This situation best fits the concept of 'coexistence,' where two species share a habitat without negative impacts on each other, unlike parasitism, mutualism, or generic symbiosis which imply more interdependent relationships."
