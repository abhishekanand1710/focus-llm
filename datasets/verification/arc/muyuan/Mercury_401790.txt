    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Birds Following Migratory Patterns",
    "reasoning": "Birds following migratory patterns is an inherited trait because it is a behavior that is genetically encoded and passed from parents to offspring, not learned from experience. This is unlike the other examples provided, such as lions preying on zebras, monkeys using twigs to get food, and bears opening coolers at campsites, which are behaviors that are learned or influenced by environmental factors rather than strictly inherited."
