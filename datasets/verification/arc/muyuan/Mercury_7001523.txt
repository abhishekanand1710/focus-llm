Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Sun.",
    "reasoning": "The Sun provides the primary source of energy for Earth's climate system, which initiates the water cycle. This cycle begins with the evaporation of water, primarily from the oceans, due to the heat from the Sun. This water vapor forms clouds, which, under certain conditions, lead to storms that transport water in the form of rain back to Earth. Hence, the energy that starts the process of storms transporting water as rain comes from the Sun."
