Question: Rhinoceroses and horses are related. They have very similar digestive systems and an odd number of toes on their feet. Horses have one toe, and rhinoceroses have three. These facts best support which claim?
Options: ['Horses and rhinoceroses share a common ancestor.', 'Horses and rhinoceroses are genetically identical.', 'Horses are the ancestors of modern rhinoceroses.', 'Horses have descended from modern rhinoceroses.']
Answer: Horses and rhinoceroses share a common ancestor.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Horses and rhinoceroses share a common ancestor.",
    "reasoning": "The similarities in digestive systems and the characteristic of having an odd number of toes suggest that horses and rhinoceroses have evolved from a common ancestor. These shared features imply a related lineage rather than horses or rhinoceroses directly descending from one another or being genetically identical."
