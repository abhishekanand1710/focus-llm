Question: The vampire finches in the Gal√°pagos Islands peck at another species of bird, the blue-footed booby, until the finches make a wound. Then, the finches drink the booby's blood. Scientists think that many generations ago finches used to peck bugs off the booby, and the behavior evolved to what it is today. Which statement best describes the birds' relationship generations ago and the relationship today?
Options: ['The old relationship was parasitic. The new relationship is mutualistic.', 'The old relationship was mutualistic. The new relationship is parasitic.', 'Both relationships are parasitic.', 'Both relationships are mutualistic.']
Answer: The old relationship was mutualistic. The new relationship is parasitic.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The old relationship was mutualistic. The new relationship is parasitic.",
    "reasoning": "Originally, the relationship between the vampire finches and the blue-footed booby was mutualistic, as the finches helped remove parasites (bugs) from the booby, benefiting both species. However, over time, this behavior evolved into the finches creating wounds in the boobies to drink their blood, which is parasitic since it benefits the finches at the expense of the blue-footed booby."
