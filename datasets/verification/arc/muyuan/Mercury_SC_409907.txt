Question: Charisma has a goldfish she keeps in a tank. She planted several underwater plants in the bottom of the tank. How are the goldfish and the plants in the tank similar?
Options: ['Both add oxygen to the water.', 'Both perform photosynthesis.', 'Both are made up of cells.', 'Both eat food.']
Answer: Both are made up of cells.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Both are made up of cells.",
    "reasoning": "Both goldfish and underwater plants consist of cells, which are the basic structural, functional, and biological units of all living organisms. This makes them similar at a fundamental biological level. While goldfish breathe oxygen and consume food, and plants perform photosynthesis to produce oxygen, the fact that both entities are composed of cells is a shared characteristic that applies to both options provided in the question."
