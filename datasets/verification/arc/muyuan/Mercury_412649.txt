Model Answer: {
    "answer": "32.0 grams",
    "reasoning": "The molar mass of water (H2O) is approximately 18 g/mol (2 for hydrogen and 16 for oxygen). To produce 36.0 grams of water, 36.0 g / 18 g/mol = 2 moles of water are needed. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, it takes 1 mole of O2 to produce 2 moles of H2O. Therefore, we need 1 mole of O2. The molar mass of O2 is approximately 32 g/mol (16*2). As such, to produce 36.0 grams of water, 32.0 grams of oxygen gas are needed."
