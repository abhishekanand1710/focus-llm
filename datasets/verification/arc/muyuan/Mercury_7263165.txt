Question: The cellular membrane surrounds every human cell. The membrane protects the cell and transmits information about the cell's surroundings to organelles inside the cell. What organ system provides a similar function in the human body?
Options: ['endocrine system', 'skeletal system', 'integumentary system', 'lymphatic system']
Answer: integumentary system

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "integumentary system",
    "reasoning": "The integumentary system is analogous to the cellular membrane in its functions of protection and information transmission regarding the surroundings. This system, comprising primarily the skin, acts as a protective barrier for the body, much like the cellular membrane does for the cell, and it also gathers sensory inputs from the environment, which is comparable to the membrane's role in signaling conditions to the cell's interior."
