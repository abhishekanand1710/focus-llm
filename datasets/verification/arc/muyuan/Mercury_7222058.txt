Question: Four students are investigating the effect of the force of a baseball bat on a ball. They marked the four different points where each of the balls made contact on the bat after each strike by each of the four students. Which of the following describes an error in the experimental design?
Options: ['failure to conduct enough trials', 'not considering the spin of the ball', 'not using balls of different masses', 'failure to define one testable variable']
Answer: failure to define one testable variable

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "failure to define one testable variable",
    "reasoning": "In an experiment investigating the effect of the force of a baseball bat on a ball, defining a single testable variable is crucial for clarity and specific understanding of what is being measured. The mistake here lies in not isolating a single factor or variable such as the force at the moment of contact, the spin of the ball, or the mass of the ball, which could directly influence the experiment's outcome. Without narrowing down to one variable, variations in the experiment's results could be attributed to multiple changing factors, leading to unclear or unreliable conclusions. This issue is highlighted by the option 'failure to define one testable variable', as it points out the necessity of isolating a single, clear variable to test within the context of their experiment's design, which is critical for deriving accurate and specific scientific insights."
