Question: A student investigates how speed changes as a ball travels down a ramp. Measurements taken by computer every second are recorded on a data table. Which diagram will best display the data from this table?
Options: ['a bar graph', 'a line graph', 'a pie chart', 'a pictograph']
Answer: a line graph

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a line graph",
    "reasoning": "Given the nature of the data being measurements of speed taken over time as a ball travels down a ramp, a line graph is best suited for displaying this type of continuous data. It effectively shows how the speed changes over time, illustrating trends or patterns in a clear, comprehensible manner. Bar graphs, pie charts, and pictographs do not provide the same level of clarity for showing data that changes over time, making the line graph the optimal choice."
