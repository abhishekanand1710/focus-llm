Question: A student pushes a shopping cart filled with groceries. The cart has a mass of 12 kilograms (kg). The student pushes the cart with a force of 15 newtons (N). Assuming the ground is frictionless, how fast will the cart accelerate until the student stops applying the force?
Options: ['0.625 m/s^2', '0.8 m/s^2', '1.25 m/s^2', '2.5 m/s^2']
Answer: 1.25 m/s^2

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "1.25 m/s^2",
    "reasoning": "Based on Newton's second law of motion, acceleration (a) can be calculated using the formula a = F/m, where F is the force applied, and m is the mass of the object. Substituting the given values, a = 15N / 12kg = 1.25 m/s^2. This calculation assumes a frictionless surface, as specified, meaning that the only force considered is the force the student applies."
