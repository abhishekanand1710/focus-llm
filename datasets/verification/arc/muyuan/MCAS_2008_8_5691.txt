Model Answer: {
    "answer": "giving feedback",
    "reasoning": "Niko's phone call to the electric company to report an outage post windstorm serves as feedback about the service disruption. This feedback is crucial for the electric company, allowing them to address and rectify the issue, fitting into the 'feedback' component of the Universal Systems Model where information is sent back to the system to make adjustments or improvements."
