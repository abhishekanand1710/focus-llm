Model Answer: {
    "answer": "cloud formations bringing precipitation",
    "reasoning": "Warm fronts are characterized by the gradual replacement of cold air with warmer air. When a warm front passes, it typically leads to the formation of extended cloud cover and prolonged precipitation, as the warm air is lifted over the cooler air in front it, cooling and condensing to form clouds which can bring precipitation. This is more common than tornado formations, which are typically associated with cold fronts and violent air mass collisions, and does not directly relate to low temperatures which are more characteristic of cold fronts or high-latitude regions."
