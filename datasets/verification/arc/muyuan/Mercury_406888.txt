Model Answer: {
    "answer": "10 m/s",
    "reasoning": "Out of the given options, only '10 m/s' (meters per second) is a measurement that describes the motion of an object. It is a unit of speed, which is directly related to describing how the position of something changes over time. Centimeters and grams are units of length and mass respectively, and they describe static properties, not motion. Newtons measure force, which, while related to motion, is not a direct description of motion itself."
