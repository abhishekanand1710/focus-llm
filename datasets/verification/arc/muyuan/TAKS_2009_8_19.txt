Question: In a healthy forest, dead trees and limbs fall to the ground and decompose. Which of these statements best describes why decomposition is important to a forest ecosystem?
Options: ['Nutrients are released when wood is broken down.', 'Worms produce oxygen used by other organisms.', 'Dead trees provide nest sites for many different species of birds.', 'Water is stored in dead trees and limbs.']
Answer: Nutrients are released when wood is broken down.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Nutrients are released when wood is broken down.",
    "reasoning": "The decomposition process in a forest ecosystem is crucial for breaking down dead trees and limbs into simpler organic matter. This process results in the release of nutrients back into the soil, which are essential for the growth and maintenance of the forest ecosystem. The interplay between decomposition, nutrient release, and the nourishment of the ecosystem aligns with the given option that nutrients are released when wood is broken down."
