    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "genetics",
    "reasoning": "The significant size difference between tigers and household cats is primarily determined by their genetics. Genetics are responsible for the physical traits and some behavioral aspects of both animals. Despite sharing a common family, Felidae, and thus having a related biochemical makeup, their distinct genetic makeup leads to vast differences in size. The habitat size they require is a consequence of their size, but not a cause of it. Behavioral makeup could influence aspects of their life and interaction but is not the primary cause of their physical size difference."
