Question: A student adds water and detergent to a cup of soil. The mixture is shaken and allowed to settle. The student observes that silt particles stay suspended long after the other particles form layers at the bottom of the jar. The most likely explanation is that the silt particles are

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "less dense.",
    "reasoning": "The observation that silt particles stay suspended in the water and detergent mixture long after other particles have settled suggests that these particles are less dense than the others. Density plays a crucial role in determining how particles behave in a suspension; less dense particles tend to stay suspended longer because they have a lower mass-to-volume ratio. This characteristic leads to slower settling compared to heavier (denser) particles. The other options, such as 'organic', 'dissolving', or 'moving faster', do not directly explain the prolonged suspension of silt particles as effectively as the concept of density does."
