Model Answer: {
    "answer": "have complete outermost energy levels.",
    "reasoning": "The noble gases rarely react with other elements because they have complete outermost energy levels, making them chemically inert. The completion of these energy levels means that noble gases have a stable electron configuration that does not easily allow them to participate in chemical reactions, unlike other elements that seek to fill or empty their outermost shells to achieve stability."
