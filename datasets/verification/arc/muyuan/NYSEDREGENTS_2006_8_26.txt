Question: Although change in multicellular species usually takes thousands of years, some species of bacteria undergo major changes in just a few years. One reason for this difference is that these bacteria
Options: ['are microscopic', 'do not contain DNA', 'reproduce very quickly', 'cause infectious diseases']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "reproduce very quickly",
    "reasoning": "The primary reason that some species of bacteria undergo major changes in just a few years is attributed to their high reproduction rate. Bacteria can reproduce quickly, leading to a greater number of generations over a shorter period. This accelerated generational turnover increases the opportunities for genetic variations and adaptations, facilitating rapid evolutionary changes compared to multicellular species that reproduce at a slower rate."
