        "description": "Genetic inheritance involves the transmission of traits from both the father and the mother to the son"
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "from both his father and his mother",
    "reasoning": "The process of genetic inheritance ensures that a son receives traits from both his father and his mother, as half of his genetic material comes from each parent. This biological principle dictates that traits and characteristics of an individual are the result of the combination of genetic information from both parents."
