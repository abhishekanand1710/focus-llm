Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It will become a solid.",
    "reasoning": "When heat energy is removed from water, its temperature decreases. If enough heat is removed to lower the temperature of the water below its freezing point, the water transitions from a liquid to a solid state, commonly referred to as freezing. This process is described by the transition described in the relationships, where the concept of 'Heat Energy' removal is directly linked to water transitioning to a 'Solid' through the process of 'Freezing'. All other options are unrelated to the removal of heat energy, as boiling and gasification require the addition of heat, and changes in weight are not directly caused by temperature changes."
