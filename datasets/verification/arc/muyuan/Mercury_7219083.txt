Question: The radioactive isotope content of a rock can be used to identify which property of the rock?
Options: ['the total mass of the rock', 'the rate at which the rock formed', 'the types of fossils that the rock contains', 'the amount of time passed since the rock formed']
Answer: the amount of time passed since the rock formed

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the amount of time passed since the rock formed",
    "reasoning": "The radioactive isotope content in a rock decays over a known and measurable rate (half-life), which can be used to calculate the amount of time that has passed since the rock was formed. This concept utilizes the principle of radioactive decay as a 'clock' for dating rocks, making it possible to determine their age. This relationship between radioactive isotope content and estimating the age of rocks is fundamental in geology, particularly in the fields of stratigraphy and historical geology."
