Question: Which of the following is an example of an escape strategy that is used to avoid being killed and eaten by predators?
Options: ['Deer shed their antlers in the fall.', 'Newts drop their tails when threatened.', 'Anglerfish produce light to attract other fish.', 'Otters produce oil to coat their fur and make it waterproof.']
Answer: Newts drop their tails when threatened.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "'Newts drop their tails when threatened.'",
    "reasoning": "Newt tail dropping is directly identified as an escape strategy, where newts can actively detach their tail to distract or evade a predator, allowing them to escape. This mechanism is specifically employed to avoid predation, in contrast to the other options which serve different primary functions not directly related to escaping predators."
