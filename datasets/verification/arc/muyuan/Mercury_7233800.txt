Model Answer: {
    "answer": "swamp",
    "reasoning": "The formation of natural gas reserves is closely tied to the decay of organic matter under specific conditions of heat and pressure, typically found in sedimentary rock formations. Swamps, being environments rich in organic matter that can decay to form the organic material precursor to fossil fuels, including natural gas, are therefore the most likely type of landscape that existed millions of years ago where current natural gas reserves are found. This is because the wetland conditions of swamps are conducive to the preservation and decay of organic materials, eventually leading to the formation of natural gas through geological processes over millions of years."
