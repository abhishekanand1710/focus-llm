Model Answer: {
    "answer": "metal",
    "reasoning": "Metal has a high thermal conductivity, meaning it can transfer heat more efficiently than the other materials listed. As ice water is poured into a metal cup, the heat (or rather, the lack of it due to the coldness of the ice water) is transferred more quickly to the outside of the cup. Therefore, the metal cup will feel the coldest to the touch after one minute, due to its efficient heat transfer properties."
