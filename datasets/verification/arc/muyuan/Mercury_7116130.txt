Question: The rate of growth for a species of grass was measured in a treeless yard and tree-shaded yard. The grass grew twice as fast in the treeless yard. Which factor most likely contributed to the difference in growth rate?
Options: ['amount of animals', 'amount of light', 'amount of soil', 'amount of rain']
Answer: amount of light

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "amount of light",
    "reasoning": "The difference in growth rate between the treeless and tree-shaded yard is most likely due to the amount of light. In a treeless yard, there is more light available for photosynthesis, which is a crucial process for plant growth. Tree shade decreases light availability, which in turn can reduce the growth rate of grass."
