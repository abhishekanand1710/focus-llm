    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "glacier",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, glaciers have the fewest plants and animals living in it due to their cold, moving ice environment, which is not conducive to sustaining diverse or large communities of life. Unlike oceans, streams, and estuaries that support a variety of life due to water present in liquid form that allows for a greater range of habitats and nutrient cycling, glaciers are mostly solid ice with very limited life forms."
