Question: Which fact about water is an example of a chemical property?
Options: ['Water expands when it freezes.', 'The boiling point of water is 100ÂºC.', 'Water can separate into hydrogen and oxygen.', 'The density of water is greater than the density of ice.']

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Water can separate into hydrogen and oxygen.",
    "reasoning": "The ability of water to separate into hydrogen and oxygen gases through electrolysis or other chemical reactions is a chemical property. This fact relates to how it can change into different substances, distinguishing it from the other options that describe physical properties such as changes in state or measurements that do not involve changing the water into a fundamentally different substance."
