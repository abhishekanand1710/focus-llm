]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a line graph",
    "reasoning": "A line graph is the best option for displaying the monthly population counts of three animal species in a forest over the span of five years. This is because line graphs excellently display changes or trends over time, allowing for easy comparison among the different species. Tables, while good for organizing data, can be cumbersome to interpret for trends. Pie charts are used for showing proportions at a single point in time, not suitable for longitudinal data. Scatterplots are great for showing the relationship between two variables but less intuitive for showing time series for multiple groups."
