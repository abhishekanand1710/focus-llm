Question: Directions Read the information about wind erosion then answer the question. Wind can cause erosion that changes the surface of the Earth. Wind erosion can have negative effects on the environment by removing soil and polluting the air during dust storms. What is one way to prevent wind erosion?
Options: ['People can drive off-road bikes across the desert.', 'Ranchers can let their cattle graze in areas with little plant growth.', 'Construction workers can wet the ground before driving on it or digging.', 'Farmers can remove all plant material in the soil between planting seasons.']
Answer: Construction workers can wet the ground before driving on it or digging.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Construction workers can wet the ground before driving on it or digging.",
    "reasoning": "Wetting the ground mitigates wind erosion by reducing the number of dust and soil particles that can be carried away by the wind. This method directly addresses the problem of loose soil being susceptible to wind, thus preventing erosion and helping to maintain the integrity of the soil surface."
