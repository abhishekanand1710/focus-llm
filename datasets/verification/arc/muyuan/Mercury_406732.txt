Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Egg and sperm join together.",
    "reasoning": "Sexual reproduction in animals is characterized by the joining of an egg from the female and a sperm from the male to produce offspring. This process results in offspring that have genetic traits from both parents, distinguishing it from other reproductive methods mentioned in the options."
