Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ecosystem damage and loss of land",
    "reasoning": "Using flowing water to produce electricity, particularly through the construction of dams for hydroelectric power, can lead to significant ecosystem damage and loss of land. This occurs as natural water flows are altered, habitats are submerged, and land areas are converted for the construction and operation of power generation facilities."
