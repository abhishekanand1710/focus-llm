    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "39",
    "reasoning": "The atomic mass of potassium is calculated by adding the number of protons (19) to the number of neutrons (20), which equals 39. This total gives us the atomic mass unit of the potassium atom. Electrons have a negligible mass and do not significantly contribute to the atomic mass."
