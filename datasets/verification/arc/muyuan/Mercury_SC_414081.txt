Question: A student blew air into a beach ball and sealed it. She then pushed on the middle of the beach ball. What happened to the air inside the beach ball?
Options: ['The air in the beach ball escaped.', 'The air in the beach ball became a liquid.', 'The type of air in the beach ball changed.', 'The shape of the air in the beach ball changed.']
Answer: The shape of the air in the beach ball changed.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The shape of the air in the beach ball changed.",
    "reasoning": "When a student pushes on the middle of the beach ball, the pressure inside the ball is redistributed, but none of the air escapes, nor does it change state or significantly change in type. Instead, the shape that the air occupies within the ball changes to accommodate the reduced volume and altered distribution of space caused by the pushing action."
