Model Answer: {
    "answer": "leaving a faucet on",
    "reasoning": "Leaving a faucet on is considered wasteful because it involves letting water run without being used for any productive purpose. Unlike the other activities listed, which use water for specific, necessary tasks (such as drinking, cleaning vegetables, and cooking), leaving a faucet on does not serve a constructive use and leads to unnecessary water waste."
