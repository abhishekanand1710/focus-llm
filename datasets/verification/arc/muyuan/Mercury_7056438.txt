Model Answer: {
    "answer": "liquid oceans and solid glaciers",
    "reasoning": "The freezing point of water directly enables water to transition between its liquid and solid states, allowing it to exist as liquid in the form of oceans (both freshwater and saltwater) and solid in the form of glaciers. This transition does not directly affect atmospheric vapor, cloud droplets, or water's presence in soil and plants, which are more related to water's cycle and absorption processes rather than its freezing point."
