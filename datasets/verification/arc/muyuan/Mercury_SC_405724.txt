Model Answer: {
    "answer": "soda cans.",
    "reasoning": "Out of the given options, soda cans are made from aluminum, which is a nonrenewable resource but is highly recyclable and can conserve a significant amount of nonrenewable resources when recycled. Newspapers, phonebooks, and paper towels are made from paper, which comes from trees, a renewable resource, and paper towels are often not recycled due to contamination. Therefore, recycling soda cans is the best option to conserve nonrenewable resources."
