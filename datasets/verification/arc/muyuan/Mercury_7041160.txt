Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Oil",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided\u2014oil, solar, water, and wind\u2014oil is the only energy resource classified as non-renewable. This classification is due to the fact that oil, being a fossil fuel, cannot be replenished in a short period of time unlike solar, water, and wind energy, which are considered renewable due to their natural and inexhaustible availability."
