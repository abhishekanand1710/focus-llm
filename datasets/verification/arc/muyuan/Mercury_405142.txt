Model Answer: {
    "answer": "plant a tree each time one is cut down",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, planting a tree each time one is cut down is the best method for managing the use of trees. This approach directly addresses the sustainability of forest resources by ensuring that for every tree harvested, another is planted to replace it. It promotes a balanced ecosystem, supports biodiversity, and helps in reducing the carbon footprint. Unlike cutting down most trees or reducing recycled paper usage, which would deplete or stress forest resources, or merely building more lumber mills, which does not directly address tree replacement, this method ensures a sustainable and responsible use of the tree resources."
