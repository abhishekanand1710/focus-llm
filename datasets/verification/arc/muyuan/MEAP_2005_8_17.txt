Question: Why is it winter in North America when it is summer in South America?
Options: ['The south is always warmer than the north.', 'There is less land than water in the south.', 'North America receives less direct sunlight during the winter.', 'When it is December in North America, it is June in South America.']
Answer: North America receives less direct sunlight during the winter.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "North America receives less direct sunlight during the winter.",
    "reasoning": "The reason why it's winter in North America when it's summer in South America is because of the Earth's tilt. This tilt causes different parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of direct sunlight throughout the year. When the Northern Hemisphere (where North America is located) is tilted away from the Sun, it receives less direct sunlight, resulting in winter. Conversely, the Southern Hemisphere (where South America is located) is tilted towards the Sun at the same time, receiving more direct sunlight, which results in summer. The concept of Earth's tilt and its relationship to the hemispheres and direct sunlight explains this seasonal difference."
