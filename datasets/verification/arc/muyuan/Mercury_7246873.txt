Question: Which of these indicates a physical change that occurs during the process of digestion?
Options: ['the addition of acids to create a ball of food', 'the secretion of pepsin to change proteins to peptides', 'the breakdown of food substances by digestive juices', 'the squeezing of food through the intestines']
Answer: the squeezing of food through the intestines

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the squeezing of food through the intestines",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, 'the squeezing of food through the intestines' best represents a physical change during digestion. This process involves the mechanical movement of food without altering its chemical composition, consistent with the definition of a physical change. While the other options involve chemical changes such as enzyme activity and the addition of acids affecting chemical structures, squeezing food through the intestines pertains solely to physical transformation by moving and reshaping the food mass as it progresses through the digestive system."
