Question: In humans, the gene for a free earlobe [E] is dominant over the gene for an attached earlobe [e]. If one parent has a free earlobe [ Ee ] and the other parent has an attached earlobe ( ee ), what is the probability that their offspring will have an attached earlobe?
Options: ['0%', '25%', '50%', '100%']
Answer: 50%

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "50%",
    "reasoning": "The parent with a free earlobe [Ee] can pass either the E (dominant) or e (recessive) allele to the offspring, and the parent with an attached earlobe [ee] can only pass the e (recessive) allele. This results in a 50% chance of the offspring having an ee genotype (and thus, an attached earlobe) because there are two possible combinations (Ee and ee), and ee signifies attached earlobes. The probability calculation reflects the combination of genotypes that can occur during reproduction."
