Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Magnesium burns.",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, 'Magnesium burns.' is the only one that illustrates a chemical property because it describes the ability of magnesium to undergo a chemical reaction with oxygen in the air, resulting in a new substance (magnesium oxide). The other options describe physical properties which do not change the chemical composition of the substance."
