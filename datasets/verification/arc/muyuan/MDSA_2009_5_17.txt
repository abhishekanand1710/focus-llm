Question: A student mixed salt and sugar. Which statement describes the physical properties of salt and sugar after they were mixed?
Options: ['The sugar dissolved the salt.', 'The salt and sugar changed color.', 'The sugar and the salt were unchanged.', 'The salt and sugar formed a new material.']
Answer: The sugar and the salt were unchanged.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The sugar and the salt were unchanged.",
    "reasoning": "When salt and sugar are mixed, they physically combine without changing each other's chemical structure. Mixing them does not initiate a chemical reaction; thus, both substances maintain their original physical properties. Neither dissolves the other in the absence of a solvent (like water), they don't change color, nor do they form a new material simply by being mixed together. The correct answer is based on the fact that mixing substances like salt and sugar does not alter their individual chemical or physical properties without the presence of another factor, such as a solvent or a trigger for a chemical reaction."
