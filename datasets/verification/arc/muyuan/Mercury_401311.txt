        "related_concept": "new land",
        "description": "Polluting is more about contamination and does not directly involve the physical construction or formation of new land"
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "deposition",
    "reasoning": "Of the options provided, 'deposition' is the process most directly related to constructing new land. Deposition happens when materials like sediments are added to a landform or land mass, which can result in the creation of new land areas such as deltas or alluvial plains. Therefore, deposition is the process that most practically contributes to the construction of new land as it relates to the accumulation of materials."
