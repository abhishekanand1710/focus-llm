Question: A group of Canada geese left a Florida lake in the spring. The geese arrived at a Maine lake 2,000 km away in 40 days. If the geese traveled at a constant rate, how far did the geese travel on the first day?
Options: ['5 km', '20 km', '40 km', '50 km']
Answer: 50 km

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "50 km",
    "reasoning": "To find the distance traveled on the first day at a constant rate, divide the total distance (2000 km) by the total number of days (40 days). This results in 2000 km / 40 days = 50 km per day. Therefore, if the geese traveled at a constant rate, they traveled 50 km on the first day."
