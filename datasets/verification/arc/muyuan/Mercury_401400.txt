Question: In certain species of plants, purple flowers (P) are dominant to white flowers (p). If two heterozygous plants are crossed, what will be the phenotype of the offspring?
Options: ['100% purple flowers', '100% white flowers', '75% white flowers, 25% purple flowers', '25% white flowers, 75% purple flowers']
Answer: 25% white flowers, 75% purple flowers

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "25% white flowers, 75% purple flowers",
    "reasoning": "When two heterozygous plants are crossed, the genotypes combine in a way that produces offspring with a 3:1 phenotype ratio for dominant to recessive traits, due to Mendelian genetics. Since purple flowers are dominant (P) over white flowers (p), and both parents are heterozygous (Pp), the offspring are expected to have a 75% chance of being purple (PP or Pp) and a 25% chance of being white (pp)."
