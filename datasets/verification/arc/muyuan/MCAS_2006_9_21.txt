Model Answer: {
    "answer": "make the voltage three times larger",
    "reasoning": "According to Ohm's Law (V=IR), the current (I) in a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage (V) across it when the resistance (R) remains constant. Therefore, to triple the current, the voltage must also be tripled, assuming the resistance does not change. This direct proportionality necessitates making the voltage three times larger to achieve a tripling of the current."
