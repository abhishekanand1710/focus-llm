Key: Mercury_SC_405635

Question: A student is measuring the boiling point of a salt and water mixture. He takes one temperature measurement of 105Â°C. Which is the best way to ensure the results are valid?
Options: ['repeat the investigation', 'change the volume of water', 'add more salt to the mixture', 'do the investigation without salt']
Answer: repeat the investigation

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "repeat the investigation",
    "reasoning": "To ensure the results are valid, repeating the investigation is crucial. This is because it checks for consistency in the results obtained, thereby reducing the impact of any anomalies or errors in the single measurement. Changing the volume of water, adding more salt to the mixture, or doing the investigation without salt would alter the conditions of the experiment and not directly contribute to the validity of the initial result."
