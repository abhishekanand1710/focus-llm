    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Creating nature preserves",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, creating nature preserves is most likely to have a positive impact on the Earth's environment. This is because nature preserves are specifically established to conserve natural resources and wildlife, which helps in maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity. In contrast, expanding neighborhoods, building factories, and constructing highways tend to increase human footprint and environmental stress by contributing to habitat destruction, pollution, and increased carbon emissions."
