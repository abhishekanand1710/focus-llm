Question: Students are performing an investigation to determine the types of bacteria that grow inside their school. Which activity should the students avoid while performing this investigation?
Options: ['wearing gloves while handling the samples', 'cleaning all materials they have finished using', 'bringing food and drinks into the laboratory', 'washing hands before leaving the laboratory']
Answer: bringing food and drinks into the laboratory

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "bringing food and drinks into the laboratory",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, bringing food and drinks into the laboratory is the activity students should avoid while performing an investigation into bacterial growth inside their school. This is because it significantly increases the risk of contamination, not just for the experiments being conducted but also poses a health risk through possible ingestion of harmful substances. Wearing gloves, cleaning materials after use, and washing hands before leaving the laboratory are all standard practices in a lab setting that help maintain a sterile environment and reduce the risk of contamination."
