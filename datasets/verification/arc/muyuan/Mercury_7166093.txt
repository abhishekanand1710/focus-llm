Question: Plants can help prevent erosion or contribute to erosion. Which describes how plants could contribute to erosion?
Options: ['Plants slow the runoff of water and soil.', 'Plant roots grow in rocks, breaking the rocks.', 'Plant roots hold the soil in place against wind.', 'Plants break the impact of raindrops before they hit the soil.']
Answer: Plant roots grow in rocks, breaking the rocks.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Plant roots grow in rocks, breaking the rocks.",
    "reasoning": "While plants generally play a significant role in preventing erosion by holding soil in place, breaking the impact of raindrops, and slowing water runoff, there is a scenario in which they can contribute to erosion. When plant roots grow into rocks, they can contribute to the breaking apart of these rocks. This process is known as physical or mechanical weathering, which leads to the breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces, potentially contributing to erosion by making materials more susceptible to being carried away by other erosion forces."
