Question: Scientists analyzed the cells of an animal to determine the cause of an infection. The scientists did not agree on the results of the analysis. What does this disagreement indicate about the nature of science?
Options: ['Scientists can present data in different formats.', 'Scientific results can be interpreted in different ways.', 'Scientists are capable of making unsupported claims.', 'Scientific results are often different from the expected results.']
Answer: Scientific results can be interpreted in different ways.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Scientific results can be interpreted in different ways.",
    "reasoning": "The disagreement among scientists over the analysis of the animal cells demonstrates that scientific results do not always present a clear-cut answer and can be interpreted in various ways. This is a fundamental aspect of the scientific process, where data interpretation plays a critical role, and is supported by the relationship between scientific results and data interpretation leading to potential disagreements. This scenario underlines the importance of diverse perspectives in scientific inquiry and the interpretative nature of scientific data."
