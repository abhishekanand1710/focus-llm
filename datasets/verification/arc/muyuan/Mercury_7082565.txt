Question: In a lab investigation, students use Brand X batteries in a flashlight and Brand Y batteries in a radio. After two hours, the flashlight stops working, but the radio continues to work. As a result, the students conclude that Brand Y batteries last longer. Which statement about the conclusion of the investigation is most accurate?
Options: ['The conclusion is valid because they tested two different brands.', 'The conclusion is invalid because the test had multiple variables.', 'The conclusion is valid because they conducted the investigation in a lab.', 'The conclusion is invalid because the real names of the batteries were hidden.']
Answer: The conclusion is invalid because the test had multiple variables.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The conclusion is invalid because the test had multiple variables.",
    "reasoning": "The investigation compared Brand X and Brand Y batteries under two different conditions (a flashlight and a radio), which introduces multiple variables into the experiment (such as different power consumption rates of the devices). This complicates the ability to attribute the difference in battery life directly to the brand of the batteries alone, making the conclusion drawn about battery lifespan invalid."
