Question: If a book sitting on a flat table starts to move horizontally, it is most likely moving because
Options: ['a balanced force is being applied.', 'a frictional force is being exerted.', 'an unbalanced force is being applied.', 'a gravitational force is being exerted.']
Answer: an unbalanced force is being applied.

Concepts: [
    {
        "name": "Balanced Force",
        "description": "Force that does not cause a change in the object's motion when equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to other forces acting on the object."
    },

    {
        "name": "Unbalanced Force",
        "description": "Force that causes a change in an object's motion because it is not equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to other forces acting on the object."
    },
    {
        "name": "Gravitational Force",
        "description": "A force that attracts any objects with mass towards each other."

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "an unbalanced force is being applied.",
    "reasoning": "An unbalanced force is necessary to change an object's state of motion. Since the book is starting to move horizontally and there's a change in motion, this indicates that an unbalanced force is being applied. Balanced forces cannot cause such a change, frictional forces oppose movement (though they don't initiate motion), and gravitational forces act vertically, not horizontally."
