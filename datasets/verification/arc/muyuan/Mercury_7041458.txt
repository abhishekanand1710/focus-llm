Key: Mercury_7041458

Question: If there is a great deal of precipitation occurring in a short time, which process in the water cycle will be affected first?
Options: ['runoff', 'evaporation', 'condensation', 'transpiration']
Answer: runoff

        "description": "Condensation of water vapor leads to precipitation, completing a phase of the water cycle."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "runoff",
    "reasoning": "When there is a great deal of precipitation in a short time, the immediate effect is usually an increase in runoff. This is because the ground, rivers, and drainage systems cannot absorb or contain all the excess water quickly enough, leading to water flowing over the surface of the Earth."
