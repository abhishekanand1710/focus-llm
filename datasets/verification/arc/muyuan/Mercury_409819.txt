Question: Laura prepared to roll a bowling ball down a lane. She swung the ball back with her arm. At the top of her backswing, the ball had a velocity of 0 meters per second (m/s). She swung her arm forward to release the ball down the lane. The ball left her hand with a velocity of 12 m/s. The time it took her to swing the ball forward was 0.5 seconds. What was the average acceleration of the bowling ball during her forward swing?
Options: ['2.4 m/s^2', '6.0 m/s^2', '11.5 m/s^2', '24.0 m/s^2']
Answer: 24.0 m/s^2

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "24.0 m/s^2",
    "reasoning": "To find the average acceleration, we use the formula: acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time. The final velocity is 12 m/s, the initial velocity is 0 m/s (at the top of the backswing), and the time is 0.5 seconds. Plugging these values into the formula gives us: acceleration = (12 m/s - 0 m/s) / 0.5 s = 24 m/s^2. Therefore, the average acceleration of the bowling ball during her forward swing is 24.0 m/s^2."
