Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Mg(NO3)2 + K2CO3 -> MgCO3 + 2KNO3",
    "reasoning": "Upon examination, this equation appropriately adheres to the Law of Conservation of Mass, as the number of atoms for each element is the same on both sides of the reaction. Specifically, there's 1 Mg, 2 N, 6 O from the nitrate, 1 C, 3 O from carbonate, and 2 K on both sides of the equation."
