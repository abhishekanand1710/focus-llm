Model Answer: {
    "answer": "chemical, electrical, mechanical",
    "reasoning": "The sequence starts with the chemical energy stored in the battery. This chemical energy is then converted into electrical energy by the battery to power the train's engine. Finally, the electrical energy is utilized to generate mechanical energy, which makes the train move along the track. Thus, the correct order is from chemical, to electrical, to mechanical energy."
