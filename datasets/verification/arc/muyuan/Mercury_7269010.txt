Model Answer: {
    "answer": "core",
    "reasoning": "Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and produces its energy, occurs in the core of the Sun. This is because the core is the only layer that has the necessary conditions - extremely high temperature and pressure - for nuclear fusion to take place. The core's relationship to nuclear fusion as its site is crucial for understanding the Sun's structure and energy production."
