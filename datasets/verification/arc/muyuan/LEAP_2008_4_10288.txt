Question: How does too much fishing in an area affect its ecosystem?
Options: ['The fish will lay many more eggs to replace the fish that were caught.', 'Organisms that eat the fish could become endangered due to starvation.', 'Organisms that the fish eat will become endangered.', 'People could eat too many fish and become ill..']
Answer: Organisms that eat the fish could become endangered due to starvation.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Organisms that eat the fish could become endangered due to starvation.",
    "reasoning": "The overfishing of an area can severely deplete fish stocks, leading to a reduced availability of prey for predator species. This decrease in prey availability can cause starvation among these predators, potentially leading to their endangerment or extinction. The interconnectedness of species within an ecosystem means that the removal of a significant number of individuals of one species (due to overfishing) can have cascading negative effects on other species that rely on them for food."
