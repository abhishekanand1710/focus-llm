Model Answer: {
    "answer": "followed the directions provided by the teacher for each chemical.",
    "reasoning": "Following the directions provided by the teacher for each chemical is the safest and most appropriate way to ensure the chemicals are disposed of correctly. This method accounts for the unique properties and potential hazards of each chemical, adhering to safety protocols and environmental considerations. Unlike the alternatives like pouring chemicals down the sink or placing them in the trash, which could be unsafe or environmentally harmful without specific guidance, following teacher's instructions directly addresses the need for proper, safe disposal of lab chemicals."
