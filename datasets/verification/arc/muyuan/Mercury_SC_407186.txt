Model Answer: {
    "answer": "eating seeds.",
    "reasoning": "The chicken is able to gain energy that came from the Sun by eating seeds. This is because seeds are produced by plants through the process of photosynthesis, which uses energy from the Sun. When chickens eat these seeds, the energy stored within is transferred to them, allowing them to gain energy indirectly from the Sun."
