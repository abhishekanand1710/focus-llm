Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Sunlight",
    "reasoning": "Based on the provided concepts and their relationships, sunlight is identified as the abiotic factor in the food chain. An abiotic factor is defined as a non-living chemical or physical part of the environment, which applies to sunlight. In contrast, grass, rabbits, and snakes are all living organisms, making them biotic factors. Therefore, within the context of the food chain: Sunlight -> Grass -> Rabbit -> Snake, where sunlight supports grass through photosynthesis, and each organism serves as food for the next, sunlight is the correct answer as it is the only abiotic factor mentioned."
