Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a tinted window.",
    "reasoning": "Although the options provided all involve materials that light can be refracted through, the degree of refraction primarily depends on the properties of the material and its purpose. A tinted window's main function is to reduce brightness and block certain wavelengths of light rather than to significantly alter the path of light or focus it precisely like lenses in magnifying glasses, telescopes, or eyeglasses. Therefore, light is expected to be refracted the least when passing through a tinted window, as its design does not prioritize altering the light path to the extent of focusing or corrective vision adjustment."
