Question: Estuaries are called "the nurseries of the sea" because many species lay eggs and develop their young in estuaries. Which two features of estuaries support this role most?
Options: ['concentrated nutrients and a steep salt gradient', 'abundant shelter and concentrated nutrients', 'a steep salt gradient and shallow water', 'shallow water and abundant shelter']
Answer: abundant shelter and concentrated nutrients

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "['abundant shelter and concentrated nutrients']",
    "reasoning": "Abundant shelter in estuaries provides protection for young marine species, which is crucial for their development and survival. Additionally, the concentrated nutrients in estuaries supply the essential dietary needs for growing marine life. These two features make estuaries highly suitable as nurseries of the sea, supporting the initial development stages of many marine species."
