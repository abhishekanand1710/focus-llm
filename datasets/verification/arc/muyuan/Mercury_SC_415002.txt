Model Answer: {
    "answer": "greatest surface area and most direct sunlight",
    "reasoning": "The relationship between having the greatest surface area and receiving the most direct sunlight results in the highest level of evaporation from Earth's water reservoirs. A larger surface area allows more water to be exposed to the atmosphere, where it can evaporate, and the presence of direct sunlight increases the water's temperature, further accelerating the evaporation process. These conditions combine to maximize the rate of evaporation."
