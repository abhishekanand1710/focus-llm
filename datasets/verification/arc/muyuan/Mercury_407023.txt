Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Chemical -> Electrical -> Acoustical",
    "reasoning": "A battery-operated radio utilizes the chemical energy stored in the battery, converting it into electrical energy to operate the radio. The radio then converts this electrical energy into acoustical energy, producing sound."
