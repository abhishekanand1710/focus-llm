Model Answer: {
    "answer": "by helping to keep people from becoming ill",
    "reasoning": "Pasteurization, developed by Louis Pasteur, is a process that significantly reduces the amount of bacteria in milk. The primary relationship here is between pasteurization and its ability to lower bacteria levels in milk, which in turn helps prevent illnesses that could be caused by consuming milk contaminated with harmful bacteria. Therefore, the most direct benefit to people from pasteurization is helping to keep them from becoming ill, as it prevents the ingestion of harmful microorganisms."
