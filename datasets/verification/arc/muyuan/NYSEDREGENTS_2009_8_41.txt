    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The local ecosystem may be disrupted.",
    "reasoning": "While producing electricity from moving water is an inexpensive option and does not result in air pollution or oil spills, it can lead to disruptions in the local ecosystem. This is due to the construction and operation of facilities like dams, which can alter water flow, affect fish migration, and change the local environment."
