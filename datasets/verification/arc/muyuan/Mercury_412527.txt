    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "square kilometers (km^2)",
    "reasoning": "Given the forest's area is 10,000 hectares, and considering 1 hectare is equal to 10,000 square meters, this converts to 100 square kilometers in total (10,000 hectares * 0.01 km^2/ha). Dividing this area into sections would result in areas likely to be several square kilometers in size, making square kilometers the most appropriate and practical unit for expressing the size of the divided sections. Units like square inches, square meters, and square centimeters are much smaller and therefore impractical for this application. Hence, square kilometers allow for a direct and understandable representation of the area sizes for these sections."
