Model Answer: {
    "answer": "different plants have different life spans",
    "reasoning": "The statement illustrates the concept of varying life spans across different types of plants, as exemplified by the long-lived apple trees and the much shorter-lived bean plants. This showcases the diversity in plant life span, leading to the conclusion that different plants have different life spans."
