Model Answer: {
    "answer": "2",
    "reasoning": "The question addresses the number of sex chromosomes in human cells. Given that human cells are specified to have 22 pairs of autosomes (non-sex chromosomes), focusing on the fact that chromosomes exist in pairs within human cells, the remaining component to achieve the total of 23 pairs of chromosomes in human cells are the sex chromosomes. These sex chromosomes come in a pair (either XX for females or XY for males), making the total number of sex chromosomes in the human body 2. This is in addition to the 22 pairs of autosomes for a complete set of 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs."
