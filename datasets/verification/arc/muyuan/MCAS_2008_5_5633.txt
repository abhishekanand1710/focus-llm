Model Answer: {
    "answer": "building a greenhouse to shelter the lemon tree",
    "reasoning": "Of the provided options, building a greenhouse to shelter the lemon tree is the best solution to the problem of cold winter temperatures in Massachusetts potentially killing the tree. A greenhouse provides a controlled environment that can protect the tree from the cold, which directly addresses the key issue of temperature sensitivity in lemon trees."
