Model Answer: {
    "answer": "paper",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, 'paper' is least likely to change from a solid to a liquid state when heat is applied because it does not melt but instead burns, undergoing combustion and decomposing rather than transitioning to a liquid state. This behaviour is unlike butter, ice, and candle wax, which all melt into a liquid form upon heating."
