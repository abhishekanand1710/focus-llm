Key: Mercury_7097248

Question: An appliance manufacturer has redesigned its original electrical fan. It has made the new fan more energy efficient. This means that the new fan
Options: ['converts more electricity into heat.', 'spins at a slower rate than the original fan.', 'requires more electricity than the original fan.', 'reduces the percentage of heat lost to the atmosphere.']
Answer: reduces the percentage of heat lost to the atmosphere.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "reduces the percentage of heat lost to the atmosphere.",
    "reasoning": "The question mentions that the redesigned electrical fan is more energy efficient. Energy efficiency can be improved by reducing unnecessary heat loss, which aligns with the option that states the new fan 'reduces the percentage of heat lost to the atmosphere.' This means that a greater portion of the electrical energy is being used effectively for its intended purpose, rather than being wasted as heat."
