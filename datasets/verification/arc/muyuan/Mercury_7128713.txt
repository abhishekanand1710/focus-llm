Model Answer: {
    "answer": "so experiments can be replicated",
    "reasoning": "The primary reason for providing detailed, accurate records from scientific investigations is to enable the replication of experiments. This ensures that scientific findings can be confirmed, which is a fundamental aspect of the scientific method. Replication helps in validating the results through repeated experiments under similar conditions, thereby establishing reliability and accuracy in scientific research."
