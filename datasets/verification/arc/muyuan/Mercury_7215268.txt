Question: Which of these statements best describes a possible environmental consequence in constructing a large-scale wind farm to generate electricity?
Options: ['Wind farms alter the regional climate.', 'Wind farms can disrupt migrating wildlife.', 'Wind farms use a renewable energy source.', 'Wind farms generate direct current electricity.']
Answer: Wind farms can disrupt migrating wildlife.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Wind farms can disrupt migrating wildlife.",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, the most accurate environmental consequence of constructing large-scale wind farms is the disruption to migrating wildlife. Wind farms have been documented to affect birds and bats, especially those on migration paths, due to collisions with turbines and habitat disturbance. The other options either describe broader or inaccurate consequences (e.g., altering regional climate is a more complex and less directly observed impact, and wind farms typically generate alternating current, not direct current electricity). The use of a renewable energy source is a positive aspect of wind farms, rather than a consequence."
