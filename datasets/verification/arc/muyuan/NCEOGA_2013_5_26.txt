Question: A student notices that an inflated balloon gets larger when it is warmed by a lamp. Which best describes the mass of the balloon as a result of this change?
Options: ['The mass of the balloon increases because the size of the balloon has increased.', 'The mass of the balloon increases because the temperature of the balloon has increased.', 'The mass of the balloon stays the same because the gas inside the balloon still has the same mass after it warms up.', 'The mass of the balloon stays the same because warming decreases the mass enough to cancel out the effect of increasing the size.']
Answer: The mass of the balloon stays the same because the gas inside the balloon still has the same mass after it warms up.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The mass of the balloon stays the same because the gas inside the balloon still has the same mass after it warms up.",
    "reasoning": "When the balloon is warmed and its volume increases due to thermal expansion, the temperature of the gas inside increases, leading to an increase in volume. However, the mass of the gas inside the balloon remains unchanged because the amount of matter (mass) does not increase or decrease due to temperature changes, in accordance with the conservation of mass. Thus, despite the physical changes in volume and temperature, the mass of the balloon and its contents remains constant."
