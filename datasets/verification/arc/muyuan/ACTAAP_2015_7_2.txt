Question: A reflex can protect the body from harm. Which organ systems work together to produce a reflex?
Options: ['nervous and immune systems', 'nervous and muscular systems', 'circulatory and immune systems', 'circulatory and muscular systems']
Answer: nervous and muscular systems

        "description": "Comprises all the muscles in the body and enables movement of the body and internal organs"
    },
    {
        "name": "Immune system",
        "description": "A complex network of cells and proteins that defends the body against infection"
    },
    {
        "name": "Circulatory system",

        "concept": "Nervous system",
        "relationship": "does not directly interact with",
        "related_concept": "Circulatory system",
        "description": "The primary function of the nervous system is signal transmission, not circulation of blood"
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "nervous and muscular systems",
    "reasoning": "A reflex is an automatic response to a stimulus that involves the nervous and muscular systems. The nervous system detects the stimulus and sends a signal to the muscular system, causing it to react and protect the body from harm. The immune and circulatory systems do not play a direct role in the reflex action."
