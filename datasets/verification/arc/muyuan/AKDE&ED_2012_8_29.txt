Question: A research scientist repeatedly observes a bird avoiding a specific butterfly species even  though it eats other types of butterflies. Which statement most likely explains the behavior of the bird?
Options: ['The behavior is a random act.', 'The behavior is the result of a genetic mutation.', "The behavior is inherited from the bird's parents.", 'The behavior is learned over the lifetime of the bird.']
Answer: The behavior is learned over the lifetime of the bird.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The behavior is learned over the lifetime of the bird.",
    "reasoning": "Given the context that the bird avoids a specific butterfly species while consuming other types, it indicates a particular response developed through experience. This specific behavior is less likely to be a result of genetic mutations or inherited behavior since it is a targeted response to a specific type of butterfly, which suggests an adaptation or a learned behavior over time rather than a random act or inherent instinct. Unlike a genetic mutation or inherited behavior, learned behavior stems from the bird's interaction with its environment, potentially after experiencing or observing negative consequences from trying to eat that specific butterfly species."
