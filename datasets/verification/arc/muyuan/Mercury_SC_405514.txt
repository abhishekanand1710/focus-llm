Question: A student plans to design a new toothpaste tube that will give the same amount of toothpaste every time it is squeezed. Which should the student do first when designing the new tube?
Options: ['make a data table of amounts of toothpaste', 'gather building materials', 'create models of old toothpaste tubes', 'draw a few possible solutions']
Answer: draw a few possible solutions

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "draw a few possible solutions",
    "reasoning": "The initial step in designing a new product, such as a toothpaste tube that dispenses a consistent amount, typically involves brainstorming and visualizing ideas. Drawing a few possible solutions allows the student to conceptualize different approaches and mechanisms that could enable the toothpaste tube to function as desired. This step comes before detailed data collection, gathering materials, or creating models, as it helps to define the direction and scope of the project in a tangible form. It leverages the relationship of 'Drawing' as a starting point in the 'Design Process' to visualize 'Solutions', enabling the definition and refinement of the product's concept before moving into more detailed planning and development."
