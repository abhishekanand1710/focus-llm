Question: According to the fossil record, the first horses were smaller than modern species. Throughout time, horses have gradually changed
Options: ['to become better hunters.', 'in order to re-populate the Earth.', 'in response to an altering environment.', 'to become useful for humans.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "in response to an altering environment.",
    "reasoning": "The fossil record provides evidence of evolution, demonstrating how the first horses have evolved into modern species. This evolutionary process is primarily driven by changes in the environment, which necessitates adaptation for survival. None of the other options are directly supported by the principles of evolution and the evidence presented by the fossil record as influences on the changes observed in horse species over time."
