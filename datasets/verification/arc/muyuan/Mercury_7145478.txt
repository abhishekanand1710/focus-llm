Question: Many fertilizers contain organic materials that are helpful to an orchard but have a different effect when rain causes them to run off into a freshwater ecosystem. How does the addition of organic waste from fertilizers most commonly affect freshwater ecosystems?
Options: ['increasing biodiversity', 'increasing water clarity', 'decreasing algae blooms', 'decreasing oxygen levels']
Answer: decreasing oxygen levels

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "decreasing oxygen levels",
    "reasoning": "The addition of organic waste from fertilizers to freshwater ecosystems most commonly results in decreasing oxygen levels. This is because the organic materials in the fertilizers promote algae blooms when they run off into freshwater systems. These blooms consume a significant amount of oxygen, depleting the oxygen levels in the water and affecting aquatic life."
