Question: Which is the most reliable way to get unbiased results when conducting a controlled experiment?
Options: ['Use more than one control group.', 'Try a different experimental group.', 'Change the hypothesis if it is incorrect.', 'Repeat the procedure exactly the same each time.']
Answer: Repeat the procedure exactly the same each time.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Repeat the procedure exactly the same each time.",
    "reasoning": "Repeating an experiment in exactly the same way each time is the most reliable method to ensure unbiased results. It increases the validity and reliability of the results. By performing the experiment multiple times under the same conditions, researchers can minimize variability and confirm the accuracy of their results. This method is supported by the relationship between 'Repeated Measures' and 'Experimental Results', highlighting how repetition increases the reliability of results as discrepancies can be identified and addressed, ensuring the results are due to the variables being tested and not external factors."
