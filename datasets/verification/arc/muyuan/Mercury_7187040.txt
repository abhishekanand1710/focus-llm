Question: Scientists launch a rocket into space for a mission. Once the rocket escapes the gravitational pull of Earth, how will the mass and weight of the rocket be affected?
Options: ['The mass and weight will change.', 'The mass and weight will stay the same.', 'The mass will stay the same, but the weight will change.', 'The mass will change, but the weight will stay the same.']
Answer: The mass will stay the same, but the weight will change.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The mass will stay the same, but the weight will change.",
    "reasoning": "The mass of an object, including a rocket, is constant and does not change regardless of its location in the universe, including space. The weight of an object, however, depends on the gravitational force exerted on it. As a rocket escapes Earth's gravitational pull and moves into space, where the effect of Earth's gravity diminishes, its weight decreases, but its mass remains unchanged."
