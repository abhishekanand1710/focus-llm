Options: ['metamorphic rock to igneous rock', 'igneous rock to metamorphic rock', 'metamorphic rock to sedimentary rock', 'sedimentary rock to metamorphic rock']
Answer: sedimentary rock to metamorphic rock

Model Response:

    {
        "name": "metamorphic rock",
        "description": "Rock that has undergone transformation by heat, pressure, or other natural processes"
    },

        "description": "Rock formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava"
    },
    {
        "name": "sedimentary rock",
        "description": "Rock that has formed through the deposition and solidification of sediment, especially sediment transported by water, ice, and wind"
    },

        "name": "gaps in the fossil record",
        "description": "Periods or areas for which there is little or no fossil evidence, making it hard to trace the evolution of life"

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "sedimentary rock to metamorphic rock",
    "reasoning": "The transition from sedimentary to metamorphic rock is most responsible for gaps in the fossil record. This is because sedimentary rocks, which are the primary repositories for fossils, can be transformed into metamorphic rocks through high pressure and temperature. This process can distort, destroy, or otherwise obscure the fossils within them, leading to gaps in the fossil record that make it difficult to trace the evolution of life across geological time."
