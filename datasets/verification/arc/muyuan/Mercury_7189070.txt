Question: The gametes of human males and females have the same number of chromosomes. Which best describes what happens to the chromosomes when typical male and female gametes combine to produce offspring?
Options: ['The chromosomes change shape.', 'The number of chromosomes doubles.', 'The chromosomes become larger in size.', 'The number of chromosomes reduces by half.']
Answer: The number of chromosomes doubles.

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The number of chromosomes doubles.",
    "reasoning": "When a male gamete (sperm cell) combines with a female gamete (egg cell) during fertilization, each contributes its 23 chromosomes to the resulting zygote. This process doubles the number of chromosomes, from 23 in each gamete to the typical 46 in the zygote, which is the initial cell of a new organism. This is necessary to ensure that the offspring has the correct number of chromosomes for its species, in this case, for humans."
