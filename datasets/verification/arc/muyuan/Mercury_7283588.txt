Question: What do the energy resources uranium and coal have in common?
Options: ['They both are formed from the remains of dead organisms.', 'They both are acquired by mining the lithosphere.', 'They both release energy through combustion.', 'They both generate radioactive wastes.']
Answer: They both are acquired by mining the lithosphere.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They both are acquired by mining the lithosphere.",
    "reasoning": "Both uranium and coal are extracted from the Earth's lithosphere through the process of mining. Unlike the other options, this activity is common to both energy resources. Uranium, used in nuclear reactors, and coal, used for combustion to release energy, are both mined but differ significantly in their use, byproducts, and origins (uranium is a heavy metal, while coal is organic in nature, formed from the remains of dead plants)."
