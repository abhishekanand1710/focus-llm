Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Earth changes position in its orbit during different seasons.",
    "reasoning": "The primary reason different stars are seen during different seasons is due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. As Earth revolves, our perspective changes, presenting different sections of the night sky throughout the year. This movement allows us to see stars and constellations that are not visible at other times of the year, while some stars become obscured by the Sun's light or the daytime sky."
