Model Answer: {
    "answer": "electricity.",
    "reasoning": "Solar cells are designed to absorb energy from the sun and convert it directly into electricity. This electrical energy is then used to power household appliances. Options such as 'heat', 'light', and 'radiation' represent either forms of energy that solar cells absorb (like light and radiation) or byproducts (such as heat during conversion), not the intended converted output for powering appliances."
