        "name": "satellite",
        "description": "A tool used for observing the Earth's atmosphere and surface from space to gather weather information."
    },
    {
        "name": "seismic",
        "description": "Related to earthquakes or other vibrations of the Earth and its crust."
    },
    {
        "name": "volcanic",
        "description": "Pertaining to the eruption of molten rock, ash, and gases from beneath the Earth's surface."
    },
    {
        "name": "hurricane",
        "description": "A type of intense tropical cyclone characterized by strong winds and heavy rain."
    },

        "related_concept": "hurricane",
        "description": "Hurricanes, being weather phenomena, are often tracked and illustrated on weather maps."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "hurricane",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, hurricanes are directly related to weather phenomena and are most likely to be included on a weather map. Weather maps predominantly depict atmospheric conditions and weather events such as hurricanes, using data gathered from satellites and other meteorological tools. Seismic and volcanic activities are geological phenomena and are not typically included in weather maps, which focus on meteorological information."
