    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a fiberglass bumper",
    "reasoning": "The only option among those listed that qualifies as a composite material is 'a fiberglass bumper'. This is because fiberglass is a material made by embedding glass fibers in a resin matrix, making it a composite material. This property differentiates it from the other options (glass, bronze, and aluminum), which are either single materials or alloys and do not meet the definition of a composite material."
