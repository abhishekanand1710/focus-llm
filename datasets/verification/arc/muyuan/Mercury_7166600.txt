Model Answer: {
    "answer": "mosses",
    "reasoning": "Among the options given, mosses have the most direct relationship with increasing the chemical weathering of rocks. Mosses grow directly on rock surfaces and contribute significantly to the chemical weathering process by breaking down these surfaces with their biotic activity, as captured in the defined relationships. Plant seedlings also contribute to chemical weathering, but mosses are particularly adapted to growing on rocks and can initiate the weathering process more directly than seedlings, which require soil to germinate and grow."
