    },
    {
        "name": "petroleum",
        "description": "A liquid mixture of hydrocarbons that is present in certain rock strata and can be extracted and refined to produce fuels."
    },

        "description": "Sunlight is replenished naturally and can be used repeatedly, making it a renewable resource."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "sunlight",
    "reasoning": "Sunlight is identified as a renewable resource because it is naturally replenished and can be used repeatedly over time, making it sustainable and inexhaustible on a human time scale, unlike coal, minerals, and petroleum which are not renewed in a human lifespan."
