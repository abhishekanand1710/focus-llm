Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Polygenic inheritance",
    "reasoning": "Fraternal twins may or may not share similar characteristics primarily due to polygenic inheritance. This is because traits that are influenced by multiple genes can vary significantly between individuals, including fraternal twins who share, on average, 50% of their genes. While the other options such as independent assortment, multiple alleles, and incomplete dominance also play roles in genetic variation, polygenic inheritance is the key reason why fraternal twins might display different physical or behavioral traits since it involves multiple genes contributing to a single trait."
