Question: A child rides a wagon down a hill. Eventually, the wagon comes to a stop. Which is most responsible for causing the wagon to stop?
Options: ['gravity acting on the wagon', 'friction acting on the wagon', 'the mass of the wagon', 'the mass of the child']
Answer: friction acting on the wagon

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "friction acting on the wagon",
    "reasoning": "While gravity initiates the motion downhill, it's the friction between the wagon's wheels and the ground (as well as possible air resistance) that ultimately opposes this motion, causing the wagon to slow down and stop. The mass of the wagon and the child influence how gravity and friction affect them, but friction is the primary force directly responsible for halting the motion."
