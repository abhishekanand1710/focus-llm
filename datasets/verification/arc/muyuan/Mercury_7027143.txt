Question: A new battery claims that it "lasts twice as long as competing batteries under the same loading conditions." Which comparison of the battery with competing batteries would validate this claim?
Options: ['It is twice as large.', 'It contains more electrons.', 'It stores more chemical energy.', 'It destroys less energy when used.']
Answer: It stores more chemical energy.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It stores more chemical energy.",
    "reasoning": "The claim that a battery 'lasts twice as long as competing batteries under the same loading conditions' suggests it can provide energy for a longer duration under identical usage scenarios. The option 'It stores more chemical energy.' directly relates to a battery's ability to last longer because more chemical energy can be converted into electrical energy over time, directly influencing its lifespan under set loading conditions. Options like size, electron count, or energy destruction mechanisms are less direct measures of a battery's duration capability in comparison."
