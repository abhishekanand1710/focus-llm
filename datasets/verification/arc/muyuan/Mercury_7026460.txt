Question: In pea plants, the allele for smooth peas is dominant (S). If a heterozygous smooth pea plant (Ss) is crossed with a homozygous smooth pea plant (SS), which are the possible genotypes the offspring could have?
Options: ['only SS', 'only Ss', 'Ss or SS', 'ss or SS']
Answer: Ss or SS

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Ss or SS",
    "reasoning": "When a heterozygous smooth pea plant (Ss) is crossed with a homozygous smooth pea plant (SS), the possible genotypes for the offspring are either Ss or SS. This is because the offspring can inherit an S allele from the homozygous parent and either an S or s allele from the heterozygous parent, resulting in genotypes that are either SS or Ss. Both of these genotypes will result in the dominant smooth pea phenotype."
