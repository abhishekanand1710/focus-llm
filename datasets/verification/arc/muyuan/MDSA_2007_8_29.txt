Model Answer: {
    "answer": "shows the details needed for a specific purpose",
    "reasoning": "Based on the concepts and their relationships, the best model to use is one that is tailored to show the details needed for a specific scientific purpose. This approach ensures that the model's specificity aligns with the objectives of the investigation, making it more effective and relevant."
