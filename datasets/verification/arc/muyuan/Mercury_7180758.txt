Model Answer: {
    "answer": "looking at pebbles through the water in a stream",
    "reasoning": "Refraction occurs when light travels through mediums of differing densities, such as air into water. Looking at pebbles through the water in a stream involves light entering a new medium (water) from air, causing the light to bend. This bending, or refraction, of light, changes how objects (like pebbles) appear from under water, making this option the one where light most likely will be refracted."
