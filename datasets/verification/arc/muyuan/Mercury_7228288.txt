Model Answer: {
    "answer": "an organ",
    "reasoning": "An organ is comprised of different tissues working together to perform specific, complex functions vital for the organism's survival. Damage to an organ compromises its ability to function properly, which can impair the whole system it belongs to. For instance, damage to the heart affects the circulatory system's ability to pump blood, impacting the entire organism. While cells and organelles are crucial for life, their damage doesn't always compromise the function of the whole system to the same extent as organ damage can."
