Model Answer: {
    "answer": "weathering",
    "reasoning": "The process observed by the students is weathering, as it describes the natural breaking down of rocks and minerals, leading to the formation of cracks in which trees can grow. The presence of a tree growing out of a crack in a boulder is a clear example of how weathering can create spaces for biological organisms to inhabit, further supporting the concept that weathering was the process being observed."
