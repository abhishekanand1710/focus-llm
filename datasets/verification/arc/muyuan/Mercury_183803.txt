Model Answer: {
    "answer": "students pass from a crowded room into a hall",
    "reasoning": "This option best reflects the model of diffusion where individuals (students) spread out from an area of high concentration (a crowded room) to an area of lower concentration (a hall). The movement of students from a crowded environment to a less crowded one mimics the process of diffusion as described in the presented concepts and their relationships."
