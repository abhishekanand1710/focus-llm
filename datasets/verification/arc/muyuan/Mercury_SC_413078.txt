Model Answer: {
    "answer": "weathering",
    "reasoning": "Weathering is the process that causes large rocks to break down over time into smaller particles, which can accumulate and form soil. Unlike decaying, which primarily involves organic matter, earthquakes, which cause sudden ground movements, or landslides, which involve the mass movement of soil and rock downhill, weathering directly contributes to the gradual disintegration of rocks into soil through exposure to air, water, and biological activity."
