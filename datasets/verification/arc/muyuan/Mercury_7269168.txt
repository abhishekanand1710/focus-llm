Question: When is wood a nonrenewable resource?
Options: ['When more trees are harvested than are replanted.', 'When trees are harvested and replanted at the same rate.', 'When trees are used as an energy resource.', 'When trees are used as a material resource.']
Answer: When more trees are harvested than are replanted.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "When more trees are harvested than are replanted.",
    "reasoning": "Wood becomes a nonrenewable resource when the rate of tree harvesting exceeds the rate of replanting. This is because the resource (wood in this case) is being consumed faster than it can naturally replenish, moving away from sustainable management practices and towards depletion, thus losing its renewable resource status."
