Question: A cupful of water and a similar cupful of gasoline were placed on a table near a window on a hot sunny day. A few hours later it was observed that both the cups had less liquid in them but that there was less gasoline left than water. What does this experiment show?
Options: ['All liquids evaporate.', 'Gasoline gets hotter than water.', 'Some liquids evaporate faster than others.', 'Liquids will only evaporate in sunshine.', 'Water gets hotter than gasoline']
Answer: Some liquids evaporate faster than others.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Some liquids evaporate faster than others.",
    "reasoning": "The experiment demonstrates different rates of evaporation between water and gasoline, likely due to their different chemical properties, such as volatility and heat absorption capacity. Despite both being exposed to the same environmental conditions (near a window on a sunny day), gasoline evaporated more than water, showcasing that different liquids have varied rates of evaporation. This conclusion directly aligns with recognizing that not all liquids have the same evaporation rates under identical conditions."
