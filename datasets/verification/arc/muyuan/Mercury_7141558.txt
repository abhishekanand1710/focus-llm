Question: An engineer must calculate the potential energy of a roller coaster car at the top of an incline. Which information would best help the engineer determine the potential energy of the car?
Options: ['the distance the roller coaster car must travel', 'the mass of the roller coaster car at full capacity', 'the average weight of an empty roller coaster car', 'the direction that the roller coaster car is traveling']
Answer: the mass of the roller coaster car at full capacity

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the mass of the roller coaster car at full capacity",
    "reasoning": "Potential energy is directly proportional to the mass of the object and its height in a gravitational field. Given the scenario of a roller coaster car at the top of an incline, the mass of the roller coaster car at full capacity is the critical factor for calculating potential energy. The height of the incline is implied as constant in this scenario, hence knowing the mass allows the calculation of potential energy. Options such as the distance the car must travel, the average weight of an empty roller coaster car, and the direction the car is traveling do not directly affect potential energy as per the established relationships among the identified concepts."
