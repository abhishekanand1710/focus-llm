Model Answer: {
    "answer": "bobcat",
    "reasoning": "The bobcat would have the most difficult time surviving if the populations of mice, rabbits, and squirrels continued to decrease, as these are its primary food sources within the brush ecosystem. Unlike the other animals mentioned, who are primarily herbivores or omnivores and can feed on a variety of vegetation, the bobcat is a carnivore and depends on these smaller animals for sustenance. Therefore, a decline in the prey population directly threatens its survival."
