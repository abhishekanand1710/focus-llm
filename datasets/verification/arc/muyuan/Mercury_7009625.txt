Options: ['competition.', 'mutualism.', 'predation.', 'parasitism.']
Answer: competition.

        "description": "A biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked)."
    },
    {
        "name": "Parasitism",
        "description": "A relationship between species, where one organism, the parasite, lives on or in another organism, the host, causing it some harm."

        "related_concept": "Fox",
        "description": "The eagle competes with the fox for the same food sources, indicating a competitive relationship."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "competition.",
    "reasoning": "Since the fox and the eagle eat some of the same organisms in an ecosystem, their relationship can be classified as competition, as they are both vying for similar resources. This competition is a direct interaction where both species may be harmed due to limited resources, fitting the defined characteristics of competition among species."
