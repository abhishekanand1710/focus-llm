Question: A science teacher filled one balloon with helium gas and a second balloon with carbon dioxide. The helium-filled balloon rose to the ceiling, and the balloon filled with carbon dioxide fell to the floor. Which statement is an inference based on this demonstration?
Options: ['Each balloon behaved differently.', 'Helium gas has a lower density than air.', 'Carbon dioxide causes a balloon to expand.', 'Balloons can be filled with different gases.']
Answer: Helium gas has a lower density than air.

        "description": "An object's buoyancy, determined by its density relative to the surrounding fluid (air), causes it to rise if less dense, or fall if more dense."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Helium gas has a lower density than air.",
    "reasoning": "The helium-filled balloon rose to the ceiling because helium gas is less dense than air, contributing to its buoyancy and ability to rise. The carbon dioxide-filled balloon fell to the floor as carbon dioxide is more dense than air, lacking sufficient buoyancy to rise. This demonstrates that gases of lower density than air will cause balloons to float upwards, while those of higher density will cause them to sink."
