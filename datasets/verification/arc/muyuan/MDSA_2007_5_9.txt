Key: MDSA_2007_5_9

Question: A student boils 100 grams of water to form water vapor (gas). What method should the student use to determine that the mass of the water vapor is equal to 100 grams?
Options: ['measuring the amount of water vapor (gas) in the air', 'collecting the water vapor (gas) and cooling it back to a liquid', 'weighing the beaker before and after the water is boiled', 'comparing the temperature of the boiling water to the temperature of the water vapor (gas)']
Answer: collecting the water vapor (gas) and cooling it back to a liquid

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "collecting the water vapor (gas) and cooling it back to a liquid",
    "reasoning": "By boiling water, it transforms from its liquid state to a gaseous state (water vapor), as governed by boiling. The principle of Conservation of Mass states that mass cannot be created or destroyed, implying that the mass of the water before boiling should be equal to the mass of the water vapor formed. To confirm the mass of the water vapor is equal to 100 grams, the water vapor must be collected and cooled back to a liquid (through condensation), allowing for direct weighing. This method effectively measures the mass of the water before and after the phase change, adhering to the principle of Conservation of Mass."
