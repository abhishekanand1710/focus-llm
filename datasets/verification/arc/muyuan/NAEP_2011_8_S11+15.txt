Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The Sun",
    "reasoning": "The primary energy source driving the cycle of water evaporation and precipitation as rain or snow is the Sun. The Sun's heat causes water to evaporate from the Earth's surface, which then condenses in the atmosphere to form clouds before falling back to Earth as precipitation. This relationship demonstrates the Sun's central role in the hydrological cycle."
