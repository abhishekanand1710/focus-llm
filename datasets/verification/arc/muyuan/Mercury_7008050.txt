Model Answer: {
    "answer": "tree roots growing in a fractured rock",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, 'tree roots growing in a fractured rock' is the only example of organic weathering. This process involves biological activities, specifically the growth of tree roots into rock fractures, which gradually breaks down the rock. The other options describe physical weathering processes (movement by glaciers, ice freezing, and wind blowing sand), which do not involve biological activity."
