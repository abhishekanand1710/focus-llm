Model Answer: {
    "answer": "6000 m^3 of air",
    "reasoning": "First, calculate the mass of each option by multiplying the volume by their densities. For '2 m^3 of bricks', the mass is 2 m^3 * 2000 kg/m^3 = 4000 kg. For '4 m^3 of bricks', the mass is 4 m^3 * 2000 kg/m^3 = 8000 kg. For '6000 m^3 of air', the mass is 6000 m^3 * 1 kg/m^3 = 6000 kg. For '10,000 m^3 of air', the mass is 10,000 m^3 * 1 kg/m^3 = 10,000 kg. Accordingly, '6000 m^3 of air' has the lowest mass among the options."
