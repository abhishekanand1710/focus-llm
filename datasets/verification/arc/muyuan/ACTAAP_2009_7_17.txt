Question: In plants, which describes sexual reproduction but not asexual reproduction?
Options: ['Five limbs are grafted onto the same tree.', 'New plants are grown from pieces of other plants.', 'A fertilized egg cell divides to produce an embryo.', 'Offspring are produced that have the same genetic information as the parent.']
Answer: A fertilized egg cell divides to produce an embryo.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "'A fertilized egg cell divides to produce an embryo.'",
    "reasoning": "The option 'A fertilized egg cell divides to produce an embryo.' describes sexual reproduction because it involves the process of fertilization, which is a characteristic aspect of sexual reproduction wherein genetic materials from two parents combine to produce genetically diverse offspring. This process leads to the formation of an embryo, an early development stage that occurs only in sexual reproduction. The other options describe processes associated with asexual reproduction or do not explicitly involve sexual reproduction's unique characteristics, such as grafting, growing new plants from pieces of other plants, or producing genetically identical offspring."
