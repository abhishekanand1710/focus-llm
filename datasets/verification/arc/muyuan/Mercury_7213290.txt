Question: Some students used a hot plate to heat 1 L of water from 20Â°C to the boiling point of water. The students recorded the temperature of the water each minute until it began to boil. Which of the following provides the most appropriate way to represent the data?
Options: ['a bar graph with temperature on the y-axis and time on the x-axis', 'a bar graph with time on the y-axis and temperature on the x-axis', 'a line graph with temperature on the y-axis and time on the x-axis', 'a line graph with time on the y-axis and temperature on the x-axis']
Answer: a line graph with temperature on the y-axis and time on the x-axis

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a line graph with temperature on the y-axis and time on the x-axis",
    "reasoning": "A line graph is most appropriate for representing data that changes over time, such as the temperature of water as it heats up to boiling point. The temperature, being the variable that is measured and changes, should be represented on the y-axis, while the time, which is the independent variable that controls the experiment, should be on the x-axis. This setup allows for the clear depiction of how the temperature changes minute by minute as the water approaches boiling point."
