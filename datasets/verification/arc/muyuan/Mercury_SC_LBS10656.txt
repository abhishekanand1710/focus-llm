Model Answer: {
    "answer": "A teacher lights a candle.",
    "reasoning": "Lighting a candle involves combustion, which is a chemical change. This process alters the chemical substances involved, burning the wax and producing new substances such as carbon dioxide and water vapor, unlike the other actions which do not result in the creation of new substances."
