Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Most soils are found in layers.",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, the concept of 'Soil Layers' best explains how most soils are alike. Regardless of the location, type, or specific conditions surrounding the soil, it generally forms in distinct layers over time. These layers result from the deposition of materials, organic matter decomposition, and various soil-forming processes. This is a fundamental characteristic of soil that holds true across different types, making it the option that best captures a commonality among most soils."
