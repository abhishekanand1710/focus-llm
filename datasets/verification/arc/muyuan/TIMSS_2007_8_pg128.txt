Question: A sound is heard when you pluck a string on a guitar. What will happen to the sound if the same string is plucked harder?
Options: ['The volume will stay the same, and the pitch will be higher.', 'The pitch will stay the same, and the volume will be higher.', 'Both the pitch and the volume will be higher.', 'Both the pitch and the volume will stay the same.']
Answer: The pitch will stay the same, and the volume will be higher.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The pitch will stay the same, and the volume will be higher.",
    "reasoning": "Plucking a string harder increases the force applied, which amplifies the volume of the sound due to more energetic string vibrations. However, the pitch, determined by the frequency of these vibrations, remains unchanged because it is primarily defined by the string's physical properties (length, tension, and mass) rather than the force of plucking."
