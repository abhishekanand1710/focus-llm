Key: Mercury_180163

Question: When moist air comes in contact with a cold surface in the winter, one result can be frost. What has happened to the water vapor in the air to cause frost?
Options: ['It has melted.', 'It has sublimated.', 'It has evaporated.', 'It has condensed.']
Answer: It has sublimated.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It has condensed.",
    "reasoning": "When moist air comes into contact with a cold surface, the water vapor in the air undergoes condensation, transforming from a gaseous state into liquid water. This condensation process on a cold surface during winter can lead to the formation of frost as the temperature drops below freezing, causing the condensed water to freeze."
