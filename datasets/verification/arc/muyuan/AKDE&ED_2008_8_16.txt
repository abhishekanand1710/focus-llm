    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "number of teeth",
    "reasoning": "While genes can influence the developmental aspects that might determine the potential number of teeth an individual could have, they do not specifically determine the exact count of teeth a person will have throughout life. This count can be influenced by various factors including dental health, accidents, or dental extractions, which are unrelated to genetic factors."
