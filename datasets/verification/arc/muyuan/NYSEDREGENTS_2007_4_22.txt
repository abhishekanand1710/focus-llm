Model Answer: {
    "answer": "shiver",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, 'shiver' is the most appropriate response to a decrease in air temperature from 60\u00b0F to 35\u00b0F. This response is a natural reaction of the human body to generate heat when exposed to cold conditions, which is supported by the relationship between the decrease in air temperature and the body's reaction to shiver."
