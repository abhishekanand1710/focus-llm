Question: When high winds knocked down pine trees in a wooded region, it created a gap in the crowded canopy and allowed sunlight to fall on the ground. The increased sunlight allowed a dense growth of raspberry plants which protected young pine seedlings from being eaten by herbivores. Over time, the pine seedlings grew and blocked sunlight from falling on the woodland floor, thereby preventing growth of more raspberry plants. Which of these terms best describes the process of change observed in this woodlands community?
Options: ['adaptation', 'cooperation', 'natural selection', 'ecological succession']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ecological succession",
    "reasoning": "The described process involves the gradual change in the species structure of an ecological community over time, starting from the creation of a canopy gap by high winds, leading to the growth of raspberry plants and young pine seedlings, and culminating in the formation of a new pine canopy that alters the sunlight dynamics and ecosystem composition. This sequence of changes aligns with the definition of ecological succession, which is the temporal change in community structure and composition."
