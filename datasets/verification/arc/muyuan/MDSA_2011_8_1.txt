Question: During sexual reproduction, a sperm cell fertilizes an egg cell to form a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg then develops into a new organism. Which statement describes the primary advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction?
Options: ['Sexual reproduction produces identical offspring.', 'Sexual reproduction results in less adaptable offspring.', 'Sexual reproduction generates a large number of offspring.', 'Sexual reproduction results in genetic variation in offspring.']
Answer: Sexual reproduction results in genetic variation in offspring.

    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Sexual reproduction results in genetic variation in offspring.",
    "reasoning": "Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of sperm and egg cells, leading to the mixing of genetic material from two parents. This process results in offspring that have genetic variations. Genetic variation is crucial for adaptation and survival in changing environments, making it the primary advantage of sexual reproduction over asexual reproduction, where offspring are genetically identical to the parent."
