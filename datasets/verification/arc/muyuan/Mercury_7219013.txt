    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the Sun",
    "reasoning": "The Sun's gravitational force is so strong that it holds the entire Solar System together, making it the center of the Solar System. All planets, including Earth and dwarf planets like Pluto, orbit around the Sun due to this gravitational force. The Moon orbits Earth, not directly contributing to the gravitational center of the Solar System."
