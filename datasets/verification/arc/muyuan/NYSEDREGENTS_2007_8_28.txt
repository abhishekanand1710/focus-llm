    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "local weather changes",
    "reasoning": "The movement of an air mass over Earth's surface directly impacts local weather conditions by causing changes such as shifts in temperature, humidity, and precipitation levels. While air masses can have indirect effects on other aspects such as global warming or ecological succession, the immediate and direct consequence of their movement is the alteration of weather patterns in a local area."
