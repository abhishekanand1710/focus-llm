        "relationship": "cannot",
        "related_concept": "specialize",
        "description": "Single-cell organisms do not specialize because each cell must carry out all functions necessary for life."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "specialize.",
    "reasoning": "Single-cell organisms are capable of reproduction, using energy, and making protein as these are basic life processes necessary for survival. However, they cannot specialize in the way cells within multicellular organisms can because each single-cell organism must be capable of carrying out all life functions by itself, lacking the division of labor seen in multicellular life forms."
