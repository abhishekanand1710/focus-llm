        "related_concept": "Objects/Materials/Energy",
        "description": "Temperature is a measure of the thermal energy of matter but is not exclusively a defining property of liquids."

        "relationship": "is_a_physical_property",
        "related_concept": "Liquids",
        "description": "Volume is a cardinal physical property defining the space matter occupies, crucial for describing liquids."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "volume",
    "reasoning": "Liquids have a definite volume, which is one of their core properties. While their shape can change based on the container they are in, the volume stays constant, distinguishing them from gases, which can expand to fill their container."
