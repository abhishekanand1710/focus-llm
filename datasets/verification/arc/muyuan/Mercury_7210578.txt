Question: Which of these is only found outside the solar system?
Options: ['planets', 'moons', 'nebulae', 'comets']
Answer: nebulae

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "nebulae",
    "reasoning": "While planets, moons, and comets are all found within our solar system, nebulae are immense clouds of gas and dust located both in and beyond the Milky Way galaxy, hence existing outside the solar system as well. Unlike the other options, nebulae are not bound to the solar system and can be found throughout the universe, making 'nebulae' the correct answer."
