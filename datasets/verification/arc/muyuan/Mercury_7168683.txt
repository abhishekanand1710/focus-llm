Question: A plant gets the energy it needs from the Sun. The plant uses about ten percent of the energy to carry on its life functions. The plant transfers approximately another ten percent of the energy to the consumers in a food chain. What happens to most of the remaining energy?
Options: ['It is reabsorbed by the Sun.', 'It is recycled by decomposers.', 'It is stored in soil for later use.', 'It is released into the ecosystem as heat.']
Answer: It is released into the ecosystem as heat.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It is released into the ecosystem as heat.",
    "reasoning": "In ecosystems, energy transferred from one trophic level to another is often lost as heat energy due to the laws of thermodynamics, particularly the second law stating that energy transformations are not 100% efficient. While decomposers recycle nutrients and some energy is captured in soil, the vast majority of unused energy from plants and other trophic levels is dissipated as heat into the ecosystem. Therefore, the correct answer is that most of the remaining energy is released into the ecosystem as heat."
