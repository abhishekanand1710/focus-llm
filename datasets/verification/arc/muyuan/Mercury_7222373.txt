Model Answer: {
    "answer": "experience a decrease in frequency.",
    "reasoning": "The Doppler effect explains how the frequency of waves changes due to the motion of the source relative to the observer. When a galaxy is moving away from the Earth, the electromagnetic waves it emits extend in wavelength, or redshift, which results in a decrease in frequency. This change in frequency is a direct consequence of the Doppler effect and is observed with galaxies moving away from the Earth. Neither the amplitude of the waves nor their type (transverse/longitudinal) are affected by the motion of the source relative to the observer in this context."
