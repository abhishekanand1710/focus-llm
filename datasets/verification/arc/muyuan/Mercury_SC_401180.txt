Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Sun rising and setting",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, 'Sun rising and setting' is the event that occurs daily. This phenomenon is a direct result of the Earth rotating on its axis. The other options, such as 'seasons changing', are longer processes that take place over weeks or months. 'Moon waxing and waning' is a monthly cycle. While the 'Moon revolving around the Sun' is seen from the perspective of both the Moon and Earth revolving as a system around the Sun, it does not describe a daily occurrence on its own."
