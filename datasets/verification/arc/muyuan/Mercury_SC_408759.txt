Question: In Florida, both panthers and bobcats prey on white-tailed deer. How will their competition for food most likely be affected if white-tailed deer populations in Florida suddenly decreases?
Options: ['Competition will increase between bobcats and panthers.', 'Competition will decrease between bobcats and panthers.', 'Competition will increase between white-tailed deer and bobcats.', 'Competition will decrease between white-tailed deer and panthers.']
Answer: Competition will increase between bobcats and panthers.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Competition will increase between bobcats and panthers.",
    "reasoning": "When the populations of White-tailed Deer in Florida decrease, the availability of this crucial food resource for both Florida Panthers and Bobcats diminishes. Given that both species rely on White-tailed Deer for sustenance, their competition for the remaining deer will intensify as they both attempt to secure enough food. This competition is a direct result of the decreased prey population requiring both predators to compete more aggressively for the same resources."
