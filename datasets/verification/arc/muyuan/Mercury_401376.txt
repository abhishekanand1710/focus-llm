Options: ['boiling', 'stirring', 'freezing', 'evaporating']
Answer: stirring

        "description": "Stirring is not a change in state; it is merely a physical action that does not alter the substance's state."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "stirring",
    "reasoning": "Stirring is the only option that is not an example of a physical change of state. Boiling, freezing, and evaporating are all processes where a substance changes from one state of matter to another (liquid to gas, liquid to solid, and liquid to gas, respectively), which are considered physical changes of state. Whereas stirring is simply an action that involves moving a substance around without changing its state."
