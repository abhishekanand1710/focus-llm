Question: Which best describes how ice cores are important to the study of geologic history?
Options: ['They show unconformities, which signal changes in deposition.', 'They hold index fossils, which are used to date the different ice cores.', 'They contain evidence showing changes in the atmospheric composition over time.', 'They follow the Law of Superposition, which gives reasons for extinctions of species.']
Answer: They contain evidence showing changes in the atmospheric composition over time.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They contain evidence showing changes in the atmospheric composition over time.",
    "reasoning": "Ice cores are valued in geologic history studies mainly because they capture air bubbles from the past, preserving the atmospheric composition over time. This evidence is crucial to understanding changes in Earth's climate and atmospheric conditions, rather than providing data about unconformities, index fossils, or directly explaining the laws of superposition and extinctions."
