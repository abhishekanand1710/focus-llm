    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a base.",
    "reasoning": "To increase a solution's pH from 2 (which is acidic) to above 7 (which is neutral or basic), a substance that decreases the hydrogen ion concentration is needed, thus making the solution less acidic and more basic. A base is the correct choice because it is a substance designed to increase the pH of a solution by decreasing its hydrogen ion concentration."
