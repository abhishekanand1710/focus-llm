Question: A student recorded the growth rate of plants grown in the presence of two different types of music. Plants grown in the presence of one type of music grew faster than the other plants. Before reporting a conclusion, which should the student most likely do?
Options: ['use different plants', 'do the experiment again', 'add a third type of music', 'use fewer plants']
Answer: do the experiment again

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "do the experiment again",
    "reasoning": "Replicating the experiment is crucial to validate the results obtained from the initial experiment. It ensures that the observed effect of music type on plant growth is consistent and not a result of random chance or uncontrolled variables. Replication is a foundational principle of the scientific method, which emphasizes systematic observation, measurement, and retesting to confirm the reliability of experimental findings."
