Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Electricity flows along more than one pathway.",
    "reasoning": "A parallel circuit is defined by its ability to provide multiple paths for the flow of electricity. Unlike a series circuit, where electricity flows through a single path, a parallel circuit divides the flow of electricity across various paths, enabling it to reach different components independently. This characteristic is what allows for the efficient distribution of electricity in numerous applications, allowing for parts of the circuit to operate independently without affecting the whole."
