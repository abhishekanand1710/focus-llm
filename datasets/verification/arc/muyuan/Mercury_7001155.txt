Question: Before letting students use hammers to investigate how various minerals break, which question would the teacher most likely ask?
Options: ['Is everyone wearing goggles?', 'Who will get the minerals from the shelf?', 'What is the purpose of this investigation?', 'Has someone volunteered to make drawings of the breaks?']
Answer: Is everyone wearing goggles?

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Is everyone wearing goggles?",
    "reasoning": "The most likely question a teacher would ask before starting an experiment involving hammers and minerals, focuses on safety. Given the potential for eye injury from flying debris or shards, ensuring that everyone is wearing goggles directly addresses the safety concern, mitigating risks associated with the investigation. This is based on the concept where goggles are directly related to maintaining safety in scenarios where eye injuries could occur. Safety is a prerequisite before engaging in practical investigations, particularly those involving tools that could lead to injury."
