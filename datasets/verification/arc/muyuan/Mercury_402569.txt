Model Answer: {
    "answer": "table salt",
    "reasoning": "When the soft putty-like metal sodium (Na) reacts with the green-colored poisonous gas chlorine (Cl2), they form sodium chloride (NaCl), which is commonly known as table salt. This is based on the chemical properties of sodium and chlorine, where they react to form a stable compound, illustrating the transformation of two highly reactive elements into a much more stable substance used in everyday life."
