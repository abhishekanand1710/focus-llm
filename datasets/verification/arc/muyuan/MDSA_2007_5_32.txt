    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "300 grams",
    "reasoning": "Based on the principle of the conservation of mass, the total mass of the container and water does not change when water freezes to form ice. Initially, the total mass of the container and the water is 300 grams. Since freezing water into ice does not add or remove mass, the total mass of the container and water remains 300 grams after being in the freezer for 2 hours."
