Answer: wildflowers

        "name": "Secondary Succession",
        "description": "A process started by an event (like a forest fire) that reduces an already established ecosystem to a smaller population of species."

        "description": "Large, long-lived trees that usually appear in the later stages of succession."
    },
    {
        "name": "Evergreens",
        "description": "Plants that retain their leaves throughout the year, appearing in various stages of forest succession."
    },
    {

        "description": "Flowering plants typically found in the early stages of succession, known for their rapid growth and colonization capabilities."

    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "wildflowers",
    "reasoning": "Wildflowers are known for their rapid growth and ability to quickly colonize an area, making them among the first organisms to appear during secondary succession after a disturbance like a forest fire. They are crucial for early soil stabilization and serve as a foundation for the return of other species, including small shrubs, evergreens, and eventually mature oaks."
