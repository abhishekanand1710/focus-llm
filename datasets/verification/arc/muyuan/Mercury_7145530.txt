Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Enzymes enable reactions to occur at lower temperatures.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the identified concepts and their relationships, enzymes play a crucial role in biochemical activities by acting as catalysts. They specifically lower the activation energy for reactions, enabling these processes to occur more easily and at lower temperatures. This characteristic is vital for maintaining life processes at the moderate temperatures of living organisms. The other options do not accurately represent the primary function of enzymes in biochemical activity; enzymes do not work at all pH levels, they increase rather than decrease the rate of metabolism, and they lower rather than raise the activation energy needed for a reaction."
