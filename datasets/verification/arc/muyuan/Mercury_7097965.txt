    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They have similar elements.",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, 'They have similar elements.' is the correct answer because all galaxies, including the Milky Way Galaxy, are composed of similar basic elements such as hydrogen, helium, and heavier elements formed by stellar processes. The shape of galaxies, their rotation direction, and the number of stars they contain can vary significantly, making the other options incorrect. The concept of 'Galactic Elements' and its universal presence across galaxies supports this conclusion."
