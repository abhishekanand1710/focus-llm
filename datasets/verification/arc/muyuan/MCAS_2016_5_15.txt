Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the condition of its fur",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided characteristics, the condition of a wolf's fur is most susceptible to environmental factors. The environment influences the health, thickness, and quality of a wolf's fur due to varying climatic conditions like temperature, humidity, and the presence or absence of pollutants. Other options, such as the size of its feet, the color of its eyes, and the shape of its ears, are primarily genetically determined and less directly influenced by the environment."
