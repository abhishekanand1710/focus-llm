Model Answer: {
    "answer": "by adding nutrients to the topsoil",
    "reasoning": "Earthworms positively influence the topsoil by their movement creating channels that improve soil structure, thus opposing compaction. They also break down organic matter, contributing to soil fertility. Their waste contributes essential nutrients vital for plant growth, thereby enhancing the soil's nutrient content. Therefore, earthworms mainly affect the topsoil by adding nutrients to it."
