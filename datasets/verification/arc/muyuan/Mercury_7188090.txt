Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a system",
    "reasoning": "The brain, spinal cord, and nerves are fundamental components of the nervous system. They work together to send, receive, and process information throughout the body, forming an integrated network that functions as a system, not as individual cells, tissues, or organs."
