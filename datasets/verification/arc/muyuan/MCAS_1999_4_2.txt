Model Answer: {
    "answer": "'Light-colored clothes reflect more sunlight than dark-colored clothes.'",
    "reasoning": "The key reason for wearing light-colored clothes, such as a white T-shirt, over dark-colored ones like a dark blue T-shirt in summer is due to their ability to reflect more sunlight. This reflection leads to less absorption of heat, keeping the individual cooler in the hot weather associated with summer."
