Question: As part of a study, a scientist observed a number of different molecular changes in matter. Which of the following observations provides evidence of a physical change?
Options: ['using heat to burn a log in a fireplace', 'using light to produce sugar in plants', 'a cake that was baked from many ingredients', 'a bottle that was broken into many small pieces']
Answer: a bottle that was broken into many small pieces

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a bottle that was broken into many small pieces",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, only the act of breaking a bottle into many small pieces corresponds to a physical change. This is because it alters the bottle's appearance and form without changing its chemical structure, which is the key characteristic of a physical change."
