Question: How does a parachute sufficiently increase air resistance to allow the parachutist to land safely?
Options: ['by decreasing the force of gravity acting on the parachutist', 'by decreasing the total mass of the parachutist', 'by increasing the surrounding air pressure around the parachute', 'by increasing the total surface area of the parachute']
Answer: by increasing the total surface area of the parachute

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "by increasing the total surface area of the parachute",
    "reasoning": "The principle behind how a parachute works to safely lower a parachutist to the ground involves increasing the total surface area of the parachute. This increase in surface area boosts the air resistance encountered by the parachute as it descends through the atmosphere. The heightened air resistance opposes the force of gravity acting on the parachutist, decelerating their fall and enabling a safe landing. The concepts and relationships described show that changing the total mass of the parachutist, decreasing the force of gravity, or altering air pressure around the parachute are not directly responsible for the parachute's ability to slow descent. Instead, it is the expanded surface area of the parachute that plays a critical role, making the increase in surface area the correct answer."
