Question: Daffodils are plants that can perform both asexual and sexual reproduction. How does a daffodil population benefit more by reproducing sexually than asexually?
Options: ['It can reproduce more rapidly.', 'It can adapt faster to its environment.', 'It can increase the diversity of inherited traits.', 'It can eliminate unfavorable traits from the gene pool.']
Answer: It can increase the diversity of inherited traits.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It can increase the diversity of inherited traits.",
    "reasoning": "Sexual reproduction in daffodils benefits the population more than asexual reproduction by increasing the genetic diversity. This increase in genetic diversity allows for greater variation in inherited traits, which is crucial for adaptation and survival in a changing environment. This process provides a broader genetic base from which natural selection can act, facilitating the evolution of the species and improving its resilience and adaptability."
