Model Answer: {
    "answer": "2H_{2} + O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O",
    "reasoning": "Option '2H_{2} + O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O' is the correctly balanced equation for the reaction between hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) to form water (H2O). According to the law of conservation of mass, a chemical equation must have an equal number of each type of atom on each side of the equation. In this option, there are 4 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms on both sides of the equation, satisfying these criteria."
