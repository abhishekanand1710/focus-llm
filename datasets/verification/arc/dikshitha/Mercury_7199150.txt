Question: After a soccer game, Brittany sat under a fan because she was hot. Under the fan, she felt cooler than before. Which explains why Brittany felt cooler under the fan?
Options: ['Air moving under the fan is cooler than air that is still.', 'The evaporation of sweat absorbs heat from the skin.', 'Water vapor from the fan condenses on the skin.', 'The fan speeds convection currents in the air.']
Answer: The evaporation of sweat absorbs heat from the skin.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The evaporation of sweat absorbs heat from the skin.",
    "reasoning": "The process of evaporation plays a crucial role in cooling Brittany as it absorbs heat from her skin. The sweating mechanism, whereby the body releases moisture (sweat) on the skin surface, uses the heat from Brittany\u2019s skin to evaporate the sweat. This evaporation requires heat energy, which is taken from the skin, resulting in a cooling effect. Fans facilitate this process by increasing air movement around the skin, enhancing the evaporation rate of sweat. This mechanism is more directly responsible for Brittany feeling cooler, rather than the air itself being cooler or water vapor condensing on the skin. Therefore, the most accurate explanation is that the evaporation of sweat - a process enhanced by the fan speeding air movement - absorbs heat from the skin, leading to a cooling sensation."
