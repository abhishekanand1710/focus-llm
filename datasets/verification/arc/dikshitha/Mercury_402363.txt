Question: Red is dominant to white for flower color in a particular plant. If a red flowered plant (RR) is crossed with a white flowered plant (rr), what color will the offspring be?
Options: ['100% pink', '100% red', '50% white, 50% red', '100% white']
Answer: 100% red

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "100% red",
    "reasoning": "The red flowered plant has a genotype of RR (homozygous dominant), and the white flowered plant has a genotype of rr (homozygous recessive). When crossed, all the offspring will inherit one R allele from the red-flowered parent and one r allele from the white-flowered parent, making their genotypes Rr. Since the R (red) allele is dominant over the r (white) allele, all offspring will express the red phenotype, resulting in 100% red-flowered offspring."
