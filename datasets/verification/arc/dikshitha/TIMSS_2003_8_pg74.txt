Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Whales",
    "reasoning": "Cats and whales are both members of the class Mammalia, making them closer relatives to each other than cats are to crocodiles (Reptiles), frogs (Amphibians), or penguins (Birds). Even though whales are aquatic and cats are terrestrial, their shared mammalian classification denotes a closer evolutionary relationship."
