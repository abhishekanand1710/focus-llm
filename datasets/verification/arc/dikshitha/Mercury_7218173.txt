Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the main sequence star Alpha Mensae",
    "reasoning": "Among the options given, Alpha Mensae is most similar to the Sun because both are main sequence stars. This classification means they are in the same stage of stellar evolution, predominantly fusing hydrogen into helium, which is the primary process that occurs in a star like the Sun."
