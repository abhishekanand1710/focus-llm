    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "orbits around the nucleus",
    "reasoning": "The smallest negatively-charged particle found in an atom is the electron. According to the relationships outlined, electrons orbit around the nucleus of an atom. They do not reside in the nucleus itself or between the proton and neutron, but instead follow certain paths or orbits around the nucleus."
