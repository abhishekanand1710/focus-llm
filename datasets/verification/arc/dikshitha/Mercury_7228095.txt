Model Answer: {
    "answer": "conservation of cell resources",
    "reasoning": "Regulation of gene expression allows cells to manage their energy and resources effectively by enabling them to turn on or off the expression of genes according to the cellular requirements and environmental conditions. This targeted approach conserves resources by preventing the unnecessary production of proteins, which is crucial for the cell's efficiency and survival. Thus, among the provided options, 'conservation of cell resources' directly benefits from the regulation of gene expression."
