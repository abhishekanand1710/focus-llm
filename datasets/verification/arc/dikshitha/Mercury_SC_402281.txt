Model Answer: {
    "answer": "oil",
    "reasoning": "When prehistoric animals, specifically marine organisms, died and their soft parts decayed under anaerobic conditions (without oxygen), the organic material gradually transformed into what we know today as oil. This process does not specifically result in the formation of sand, coal, or shale in this context, although coal is similarly formed from plant material under different conditions. In the context of the question, focusing on the decay of soft parts, oil is the correct answer as it directly relates to the decay of marine organisms."
