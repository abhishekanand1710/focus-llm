Question: Kerry made a simple flashlight. She recorded the following statements in her lab book. Which statement is an inference?
Options: ['The wire was 35 cm long.', 'The flashlight contained a battery.', 'The plastic switch was better than the metal switch.', 'The bulb was lit for 20 minutes before it burned out.']
Answer: The plastic switch was better than the metal switch.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The plastic switch was better than the metal switch.",
    "reasoning": "Among the listed statements, the assertion that 'The plastic switch was better than the metal switch.' is an inference because it represents a conclusion derived from comparative analysis, possibly based on evidence like durability, cost, performance, or other criteria, rather than directly observed or measured data. The other options include specific, measurable facts or direct observations that do not require inference."
