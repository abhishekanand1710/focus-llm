]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a natural substance that makes up rocks",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer can be determined from the concept of a 'mineral' which is described as a natural substance with a defined chemical composition that makes up rocks. None of the other options accurately reflect the definition or properties of minerals. Additionally, the relationship identified between 'minerals' and 'rocks', where minerals compose rocks, provides the direct link to the correct choice."
