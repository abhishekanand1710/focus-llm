Question: A road cut shows a layer of shale on top of a layer of limestone. This indicates
Options: ['the shale layer is older than the limestone layer.', 'a fault occurred during the deposition of the layers.', 'the environment changed between the times of deposition.', 'volcanic activity occurred when these layers were deposited.']
Answer: the environment changed between the times of deposition.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the environment changed between the times of deposition.",
    "reasoning": "The presence of a layer of shale on top of a layer of limestone in a road cut indicates that there was a change in the environment between the times these layers were deposited. Shale typically forms from mud in a calm, still water environment, such as a deep sea or lake, whereas limestone is formed in marine settings, indicating clear, warm, shallow tropical seas. The sequential laying suggests a significant change in environmental conditions over time from the deposition of limestone to the deposition of shale."
