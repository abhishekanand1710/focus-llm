Question: Salivary amylase is an enzyme in the human body that digests carbohydrates from food. When food mixed with saliva enters the stomach, the action of salivary amylase slows dramatically. Which causes salivary amylase enzyme to stop digesting food?
Options: ['The pH of the stomach is lower than in the mouth.', 'The concentration of food decreases in the stomach.', 'The temperature of the food increases in the stomach.', 'The food is mixed more in the mouth than in the stomach.']
Answer: The pH of the stomach is lower than in the mouth.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The pH of the stomach is lower than in the mouth.",
    "reasoning": "The main reason why salivary amylase stops functioning effectively once food enters the stomach is due to the significantly lower pH in the stomach. Enzymes like salivary amylase are sensitive to pH, and the acidic environment of the stomach denatures the enzyme, rendering it inactive. This relationship between the enzyme's activity and pH, alongside the fact that the stomach's acidic environment is established to aid in digestion but inhibits the process of salivary amylase, provides a clear explanation."
