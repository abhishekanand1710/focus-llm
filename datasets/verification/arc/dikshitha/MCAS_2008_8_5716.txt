Question: Which of the following best describes the purpose of the chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell?
Options: ['to store the genetic instructions needed to specify traits', 'to release energy by breaking down food molecules', 'to transport nutrients into and out of the cell', 'to protect the cells from microorganisms']
Answer: to store the genetic instructions needed to specify traits

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "to store the genetic instructions needed to specify traits",
    "reasoning": "Chromosomes are contained within the nucleus of a cell and their primary function is to store genetic instructions, which are necessary for specifying the traits of an organism. This direct relationship between chromosomes, genetic instructions, and traits makes 'to store the genetic instructions needed to specify traits' the best description of the purpose of chromosomes in the nucleus of a cell from the given options."
