Model Answer: {
    "answer": "by determining the age of lava rising at ocean ridges",
    "reasoning": "Scientists arrived at the theory of plate tectonics primarily by examining the geological activities and materials that directly relate to the movement of the Earth's crust. Among the options provided, determining the age of lava rising at ocean ridges is directly related to the study of plate movements. This is because the process of lava rising at these locations is a result of tectonic plates diverging, allowing magma to rise and solidify to form new crust. This activity helps scientists understand the rate of plate movement and the dynamics of plate tectonics."
