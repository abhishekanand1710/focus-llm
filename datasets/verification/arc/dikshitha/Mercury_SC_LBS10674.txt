Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a candle burning",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, a candle burning represents a chemical change as it involves the transformation of wax and oxygen into new substances such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, heat, and light, demonstrating the characteristics of a chemical change."
