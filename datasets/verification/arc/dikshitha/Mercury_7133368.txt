Question: Students dropped different rocks into sand to simulate meteorite impacts. Their goal was to determine which rock made the deepest crater. Which variable should the students control in order to have the most accurate results?
Options: ['the height from which the rocks are dropped', 'the average time it takes the rocks to fall', 'the density of the rocks', 'the mass of the rocks']
Answer: the height from which the rocks are dropped

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the height from which the rocks are dropped",
    "reasoning": "Controlling the height from which the rocks are dropped ensures that all rocks have the same potential energy when they start their fall, making the energy of impact solely dependent on this height. This uniformity is crucial for accurately comparing the resulting crater depths, as variations in height would introduce significant variables due to changes in potential energy. Thus, controlling the height provides a consistent basis for measurement, making it the most critical variable to control in this context."
