Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the sun",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, 'the sun' is the only celestial object that is classified as a star because it produces its own light and heat. Mars, Venus, and the Moon do not produce their own light and heat; instead, they reflect the Sun's light. Hence, being the star that is at the center of our solar system and the closest to Earth, the correct answer is 'the sun'."
