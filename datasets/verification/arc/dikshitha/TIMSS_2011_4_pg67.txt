Question: A hot, boiled egg is put into a cup of cold water. What happens to the temperature of the water and the egg?
Options: ['The water gets colder and the egg gets warmer.', 'The water gets warmer and the egg gets colder.', 'The water temperature stays the same and the egg gets colder.', 'Both the water and the egg get warmer.']
Answer: The water gets warmer and the egg gets colder.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The water gets warmer and the egg gets colder.",
    "reasoning": "Heat transfer occurs from the hot, boiled egg to the cold water until thermal equilibrium is achieved, causing the water's temperature to increase and the egg's temperature to decrease."
