Question: Jeremiah noticed a plant had many missing leaves and large holes in other leaves. Why do missing leaves hurt the plant?
Options: ['The plant makes less food.', 'The plant takes in less water.', 'The plant attracts fewer insects.', 'The plant does not have support.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The plant makes less food.",
    "reasoning": "With many missing leaves and large holes in other leaves, the plant's capability for photosynthesis is significantly reduced. Since leaves are the primary sites for photosynthesis, their absence means the plant cannot efficiently synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. This leads to reduced food production, hindering the plant's growth and survival. The other options, although relevant in general plant physiology, do not directly address the primary consequence of missing leaves which is the reduced capability for photosynthesis and thus less food production."
