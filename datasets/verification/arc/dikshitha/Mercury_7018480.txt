Question: If an experiment results in data that do not support the hypothesis, what is the most likely step to take next?
Options: ['Change the data to support the hypothesis.', 'Perform the experiment without using control groups.', 'Make observations and form another testable hypothesis.', 'Perform the experiment using a larger number of variables.']
Answer: Make observations and form another testable hypothesis.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Make observations and form another testable hypothesis.",
    "reasoning": "If an experiment results in data that do not support the hypothesis, it is aligned with the scientific method to make further observations and form another testable hypothesis. This is because the scientific method involves the continuous cycle of observation, hypothesis formulation, experimentation, and modification of hypotheses based on empirical data. Changing data to fit the hypothesis or ignoring control groups and variables would undermine the integrity and objective nature of scientific inquiry."
