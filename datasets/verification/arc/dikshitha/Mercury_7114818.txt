    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "mutualism",
    "reasoning": "The relationship between the bird and the large mammals is best described as mutualism, where both parties benefit. Here, the bird gets a source of food by eating the blood-sucking insects, and the large mammals benefit from the removal of these parasites, reducing harm and potential diseases carried by the insects."
