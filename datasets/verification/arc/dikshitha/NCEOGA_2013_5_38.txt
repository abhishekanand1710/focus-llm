Question: In a grassland ecosystem, if the population of eagles suddenly decreased, what will most likely be the effect on the rest of the ecosystem?
Options: ['The ecosystem will become overpopulated with snakes.', 'There will be a decrease in the population of snakes in the ecosystem.', 'The nutrition of the soil in the ecosystem will decrease.', 'More types of plants will begin growing in the ecosystem.']
Answer: The ecosystem will become overpopulated with snakes.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The ecosystem will become overpopulated with snakes.",
    "reasoning": "Eagles, being top predators of snakes in a grassland ecosystem, help control the snake population. A sudden decrease in eagle population would lead to a reduced predation pressure on snakes. Consequently, without their natural predators to keep their numbers in check, it is likely that the snake population would increase, leading to overpopulation. This could also have cascading effects on other parts of the ecosystem, such as prey species of snakes and soil nutrition. Hence, among the given options, 'The ecosystem will become overpopulated with snakes.' is the most likely effect."
