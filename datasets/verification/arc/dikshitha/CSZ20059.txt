Model Answer: {
    "answer": "popping popcorn",
    "reasoning": "Out of the given options, only 'popping popcorn' results in a chemical change, which by its nature alters the chemical properties of the corn kernels. Heating corn kernels causes them to transform, resulting in new substances with new chemical properties, unlike the physical changes involved in shredding a newspaper, breaking a mirror, or cutting wood, which do not change the substances\u2019 chemical properties."
