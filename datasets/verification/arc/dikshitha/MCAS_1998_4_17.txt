Question: Which is the correct order of the metamorphosis of a butterfly?
Options: ['egg, larva, pupa, adult', 'egg, pupa, larva, adult', 'egg, adult, larva, pupa', 'egg, larva, adult, pupa']
Answer: egg, larva, pupa, adult

Model Response:
Concepts: [
    {
        "name": "egg",
        "description": "The first stage in the life cycle of a butterfly where the butterfly begins its life."
    },
    {
        "name": "larva",
        "description": "The second stage in the butterfly lifecycle, commonly known as a caterpillar."
    },
    {
        "name": "pupa",
        "description": "The third stage in the butterfly lifecycle, a transitional stage during which the larva transforms into an adult."
    },
    {
        "name": "adult",
        "description": "The final stage of the butterfly lifecycle, the stage where it emerges as a fully developed butterfly."
    }
]

Relationships: [

        "concept": "egg",
        "relationship": "transforms_into",
        "related_concept": "larva",
        "description": "The egg hatches into a larva, which is the caterpillar stage."
    },
    {
        "concept": "larva",
        "relationship": "transforms_into",
        "related_concept": "pupa",
        "description": "The larva, after growing enough, enters into the pupa stage where it undergoes metamorphosis."
    },
    {
        "concept": "pupa",
        "relationship": "transforms_into",
        "related_concept": "adult",
        "description": "The pupa metamorphoses into an adult butterfly."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "egg, larva, pupa, adult",
    "reasoning": "The correct sequence follows the life cycle of a butterfly from its inception as an egg, then progressing through stages as a larva (caterpillar), next transforming into a pupa (chrysalis), and finally emerging as an adult butterfly. This sequence is supported by the listed concepts and their relationships, where each stage precedes the next in development."
