Model Answer: {
    "answer": "nucleic acid chain",
    "reasoning": "Nucleic acid chains are the only option listed that can be found in both viruses and cells, serving as the genetic material in both. Viruses contain nucleic acid chains in the form of either DNA or RNA to encode their genetic information. Similarly, cells contain DNA or RNA as their genetic blueprint. The other options, such as the Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclear membrane, are cellular organelles specific to eukaryotic cells and do not exist in viruses."
