Model Answer: {
    "answer": "decrease the temperature",
    "reasoning": "Decreasing the temperature of water below its freezing point is a direct and effective method to change it from a liquid to a solid state. This process is known as freezing and is based on the physical principle that lowering temperature reduces the kinetic energy of water molecules, allowing them to form a rigid structure characteristic of a solid."
