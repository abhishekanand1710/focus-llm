    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "insulated clothing",
    "reasoning": "Given the extreme cold and environmental conditions of the Arctic Circle, insulated clothing is most likely to be developed by a culture living in this region for the essential purpose of warmth and protection against the cold. Unlike the other options, which are either less useful (ice production, air conditioning) or not practical due to the terrain (irrigation canals), insulated clothing directly addresses a primary need for human survival in the Arctic."
