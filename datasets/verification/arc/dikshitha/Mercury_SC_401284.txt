    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "hide from predators.",
    "reasoning": "The specialized cells that allow an animal to change color rapidly are primarily used for camouflage or mimicry, which aids in hiding from predators. This color change serves as a defense mechanism rather than affecting the animal's running speed, digestion rate, or its ability to retain body heat."
