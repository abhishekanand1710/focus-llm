Question: Which statement best describes the theory of natural selection?
Options: ['It guarantees the survival of a species.', 'It increases the size of a population.', 'It requires the individuals to be identical.', 'It happens over a long period of time.']
Answer: It happens over a long period of time.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It happens over a long period of time.",
    "reasoning": "The theory of natural selection is based on the process by which organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. This process requires genetic variation among individuals in a population and does not guarantee the survival of any one species nor does it directly influence the size of a population. Rather, it is a mechanism that operates over an extended period, through many generations."
