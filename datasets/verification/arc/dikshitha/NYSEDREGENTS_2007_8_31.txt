Model Answer: {
    "answer": "liquid to gas",
    "reasoning": "The phase change from liquid to gas, known as vaporization, is the process during which heat energy is absorbed by a substance. This is necessary to overcome the intermolecular forces holding the liquid phase together, allowing it to transition into a gaseous state. Among the given options, 'liquid to gas' is the phase change where heat energy is specifically absorbed, aligning with the concepts and relationships identified."
