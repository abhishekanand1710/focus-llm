        "name": "Photosynthesis",
        "description": "A process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism's activities."
    },
    {
        "name": "Carbon dioxide",
        "description": "A colorless gas with a density about 53% higher than that of dry air. Plants absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis."

    {
        "name": "Minerals",
        "description": "Inorganic substances required by the body for various functions, and absorbed by plants from the soil."
    },
    {
        "name": "Oxygen",
        "description": "A chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8; it is a byproduct of photosynthesis."
    },
    {
        "name": "Sugar",
        "description": "Organic compounds that plants produce during photosynthesis; primarily glucose."

        "description": "Plants absorb minerals from the soil for various functions, not directly related to photosynthesis."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "oxygen and sugar",
    "reasoning": "During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) and convert them into sugar (glucose) for energy and growth, releasing oxygen (O2) as a byproduct. Therefore, 'oxygen and sugar' are the two main products of photosynthesis, making it the correct answer."
