Model Answer: {
    "answer": "community",
    "reasoning": "Populations living in one place form a 'community'. This is because a community is defined as a group of individuals, often from multiple species, living in the same place or having a specific characteristic in common. The relationship between 'community' and 'species' signifies that multiple species can coexist within a community. Additionally, communities are found within habitats, which provide the physical environment necessary for the community's existence."
