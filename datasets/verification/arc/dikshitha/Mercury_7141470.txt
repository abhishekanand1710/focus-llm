Question: A botanist developed a new fertilizer that was tested on different types of plants under different conditions. The results indicated that the fertilizer increased plant growth. Which would be the best way to validate the results?
Options: ['have another lab replicate the tests', 'look over the results several times', 'develop a new hypothesis to test', 'change the procedure']
Answer: have another lab replicate the tests

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "have another lab replicate the tests",
    "reasoning": "Having another lab replicate the tests is the best way to validate the results. This method follows the principle of independent verification in the scientific process, where if results are true, they can be reproduced under the same experimental conditions by others. This helps ensure that the increase in plant growth observed is not due to factors like experimental bias or errors specific to the initial testing environment. The other options do not directly contribute to the validation of results as effectively as independent replication does."
