Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They are all solids.",
    "reasoning": "Ice, a rock, and a piece of aluminum share the property of being in the solid state. Ice is the solid form of water, a rock is a solid aggregation of minerals, and aluminum is a metallic element in solid form. None of these entities are liquids, minerals in a complete sense (since aluminum is an element and not a compound), or solely elements (since ice and rock are compounds or mixtures). The core commonality is their physical state as solids."
