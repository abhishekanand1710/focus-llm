Question: Some people suffer from a condition called carpal tunnel syndrome that causes pain in the wrists. Carpal tunnel syndrome can result from repetitive actions of the wrists and hands, such as typing on a computer keyboard. This is an example of using technology in spite of its
Options: ['help to society.', 'negative impact.', 'medical advances.', 'convenient features.']
Answer: negative impact.

Model Response:

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "negative impact.",
    "reasoning": "The scenario described involves Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, which results from repetitive actions such as typing on a computer keyboard, a common form of technology use. This shows how technology use can lead to negative impacts on health, aligning with the concept of 'negative impact' among the provided options."
