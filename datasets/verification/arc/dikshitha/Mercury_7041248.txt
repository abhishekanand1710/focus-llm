Question: Two chemicals are mixed together in a beaker that is sitting in an ice water bath. The ice in the water melts as the chemicals react for one minute. What type of reaction is taking place?
Options: ['endothermic, in which energy is absorbed', 'endothermic, in which energy is released', 'exothermic, in which energy is absorbed', 'exothermic, in which energy is released']
Answer: exothermic, in which energy is released

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "endothermic, in which energy is absorbed",
    "reasoning": "The question describes a scenario where the ice melts as two chemicals react, implying that energy is absorbed from the surroundings (in this case, the ice water bath) to fuel the reaction. Since the ice melts, it indicates energy absorption, characteristic of an endothermic reaction."
