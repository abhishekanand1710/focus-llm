Question: Tobias rode his bike on a road for a 2 hr period. On average, he passed a 1 km marker every 3 min during this period. Which of the following was his average speed for this 2 hr period?
Options: ['10 km/hr', '15 km/hr', '20 km/hr', '25 km/hr']
Answer: 20 km/hr

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "20 km/hr",
    "reasoning": "If Tobias passes a 1 km marker every 3 minutes, then in 60 minutes (1 hour), he passes 20 markers (since 60 divided by 3 equals 20). Therefore, Tobias travels 20 kilometers every hour, making his average speed 20 km/hr."
