Question: Ptolemy was an ancient astronomer who thought Earth was the center of the universe. When he made observations that were inconsistent with this, he proposed a phenomenon called "epicycles" to explain the observations. How was Ptolemy's process similar to the modern scientific process?
Options: ['Ptolemy based his model partly on a belief system.', 'Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations.', 'Ptolemy tried to describe the universe instead of explaining it.', "Experiments were the basis of Ptolemy's model of the universe."]
Answer: Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Observations inspired Ptolemy to modify his explanations.",
    "reasoning": "Ptolemy's adjustment of his model by introducing the concept of epicycles was a direct response to observations that were inconsistent with the initially proposed geocentric model. This process of modifying explanations based on observational data aligns with the modern scientific method, which emphasizes observation, hypothesis generation, and revision based on empirical evidence."
