Question: Bees can see wavelengths of only yellow, blue, and ultraviolet light. Many plant flowers consist of yellow, blue, and ultraviolet markings that are near the center of the flower. Which sentence describes which organisms benefit from this and explains why?
Options: ['Only plants benefit, because bees are unable to reach a food source on the plant.', 'Only bees benefit, because flowers are damaged by bees.', 'Neither bees nor plants benefit, because it does not help either to reproduce.', 'Both bees and plants benefit, because bees find food and plants are aided in reproduction.']
Answer: Both bees and plants benefit, because bees find food and plants are aided in reproduction.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Both bees and plants benefit, because bees find food and plants are aided in reproduction.",
    "reasoning": "The relationship between bees and plants is mutually beneficial: bees are attracted to plants by ultraviolet markings, which guide them to nectar, serving as their food source. In the process of searching for nectar, bees inadvertently pollinate plants, which aids in the plants' reproductive process. Hence, this interdependency ensures that both species benefit, with bees securing a food source and plants receiving assistance in their reproduction."
