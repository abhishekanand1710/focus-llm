Model Answer: {
    "answer": "removing groundwater",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, removing groundwater is the action most often responsible for the formation of sinkholes. The extraction of groundwater reduces support for the earth's surface, making it prone to sudden collapse into underground voids, directly leading to sinkholes. This relationship is more direct than the impacts of meteor impacts, tectonic plate collision, or mechanical weathering, none of which are primarily responsible for sinkhole formation in the context of the question."
