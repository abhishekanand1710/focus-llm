Question: A researcher examines a marine organism that is the size of an average human hand. Without more information, which statement about the organism is most likely accurate?
Options: ['It is mobile.', 'It has organ systems.', 'It is made of many cells.', 'It makes its own food.']
Answer: It is made of many cells.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It is made of many cells.",
    "reasoning": "Given the organism's size (comparable to an average human hand), it is most probable that it is multicellular. This presumption is based on the fact that larger size often correlates with multicellularity due to the increased need for complexity and specialized functions, which single-celled organisms cannot adequately support. The presence of cells allows for specialization and the capability to form structures and systems necessary for supporting life in a marine environment."
