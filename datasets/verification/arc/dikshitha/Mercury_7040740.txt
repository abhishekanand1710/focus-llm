Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Nekton can actively swim.",
    "reasoning": "The major advantage of nekton over plankton in locating food is their ability to actively swim. This ability allows nekton to move independently of water currents to seek out food sources, unlike plankton, which are mostly at the mercy of water currents for movement. The capability of active movement is directly linked to their effectiveness in locating and consuming food, thus providing a substantial advantage in their search for nourishment."
