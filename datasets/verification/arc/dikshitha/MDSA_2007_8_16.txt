Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Scientists analyze all results.",
    "reasoning": "The option 'Scientists analyze all results' is the correct answer because it specifically addresses how scientists maintain objectivity during experiments. Objectivity is achieved by analyzing all results impartially, regardless of whether they support or refute the hypotheses being tested. This is essential for ensuring that the conclusions drawn from an experiment are based on evidence rather than the experimenter's expectations or biases. The other options either do not directly relate to maintaining objectivity ('Scientists use safety precautions.'), are incorrect practices ('Scientists conduct experiments once.', 'Scientists change at least two variables.'), or do not specifically address how objectivity is maintained during the experimental process."
