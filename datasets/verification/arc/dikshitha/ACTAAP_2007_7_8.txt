Question: When performing an experiment for a science fair, what should be done if the data do not support the hypothesis?
Options: ['Check for errors and run the experiment again.', 'Change the hypothesis to match the conclusion.', 'Change the variable so the data will match the hypothesis.', 'Ignore the data and prepare the science fair display anyway.']
Answer: Check for errors and run the experiment again.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Check for errors and run the experiment again.",
    "reasoning": "If the data do not support the hypothesis, it is scientifically rigorous to first check for errors and if any inconsistencies or mistakes are found, the experiment should be run again. This approach ensures accuracy and reliability of the results, staying true to the scientific method. Changing the hypothesis to match the data, altering variables to force a match, or ignoring the data compromises the integrity of the scientific process and findings."
