Question: What most likely happens when a cold air mass comes into contact with a warm, moist air mass?
Options: ['The sky becomes clear.', 'Rain or snow begins to fall.', 'Cold air is pushed to high altitudes.', 'Warm air is pushed to ground level.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Rain or snow begins to fall.",
    "reasoning": "When a cold air mass comes into contact with a warm, moist air mass, the colder, denser air pushes under the lighter, warmer air, causing the warm air to rise. As it rises, it cools, causing the moisture to condense into droplets or ice crystals, leading to precipitation in the form of rain or snow. This process naturally rules out the other options, as it's the interaction and resulting lift of the warm air mass that precipitates the weather change, not the displacement of the cold air upwards or the warming of ground level."
