Question: A student used the dimmest setting on a light microscope to observe a euglena and an amoeba. The student shined a narrow beam of light at the top of the cover slip. She observed that the euglena swam up toward the light but the amoeba did not. She knew the amoeba was alive because it slowly changed shape while she watched. What inference should the student draw from her observation?
Options: ['An amoeba can only move side to side.', 'An amoeba is unable to respond to light.', 'An amoeba moves too slowly to observe.', 'An amoeba only moves when it is hungry.']
Answer: An amoeba is unable to respond to light.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "An amoeba is unable to respond to light.",
    "reasoning": "The observation that the euglena moves towards the light (exhibiting positive phototaxis) while the amoeba does not respond to the light and instead continues to change shape passively indicates that amoebas, based on this experiment, do not exhibit a phototactic response. This behavior suggests that the amoeba does not respond to light stimuli in the way euglena does, leading to the inference that 'An amoeba is unable to respond to light.' The other options are either too narrowly defined or speculate on behavior not directly observed in this experiment."
