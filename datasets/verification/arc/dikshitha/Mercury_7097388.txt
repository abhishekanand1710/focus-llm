Question: Uranus is one of the outer planets of the solar system. The average distance of Uranus from the Sun is 2.87 billion kilometers. Which best explains why Uranus revolves in its orbit instead of moving out into space?
Options: ['The orbit of Neptune limits Uranus.', 'Gravity pulls Uranus toward the Sun.', 'Electromagnetic energy pulls on Uranus.', 'Other planets have the same mass as Uranus.']
Answer: Gravity pulls Uranus toward the Sun.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Gravity pulls Uranus toward the Sun.",
    "reasoning": "Uranus revolves in its orbit due to the gravitational pull exerted by the Sun. This gravitational force is what keeps Uranus from moving out into space, as it attracts Uranus towards the Sun, ensuring it stays within its orbital path."
