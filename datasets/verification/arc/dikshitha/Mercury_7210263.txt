Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It dissolves many substances.",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, the property of water being able to dissolve many substances is what enables it to transport materials through the Earth system. This is because the solvent capacity of water allows it to carry various dissolved substances within it, facilitating their movement across different parts of the Earth system."
