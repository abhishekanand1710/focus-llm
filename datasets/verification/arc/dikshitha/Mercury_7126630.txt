    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "digestive",
    "reasoning": "While the skin interacts strongly with the immune, excretory, and nervous systems through mechanisms like protection against pathogens, waste excretion, and sensory perception, it has minimal direct interaction with the digestive system. The digestive system's primary functions of food processing, nutrient absorption, and waste expulsion have little to no direct involvement with the skin, making it the organ system least likely to directly interact with the skin."
