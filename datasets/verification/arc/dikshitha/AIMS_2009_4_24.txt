Question: Tyrone put two stones in a plastic bottle of water and shook it. After he stopped shaking the bottle, he observed that small pieces of the stones were floating in the water. What is the best prediction he can make based on this observation? If shaking the bottle causes pieces of stones to break off,
Options: ['then using cold water will break off more pieces.', 'then using hot water will make the stones change colors.', 'then shaking for a longer amount of time will break off more pieces.', 'then shaking for a shorter amount of time will make the rocks change colors.']
Answer: then shaking for a longer amount of time will break off more pieces.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "then shaking for a longer amount of time will break off more pieces.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the observed effects of mechanical weathering from the shaking action, it suggests that the intensity or duration of the physical action has a direct impact on the amount of material broken off from the stones. Since shaking for a short duration caused some pieces to break off, it stands to reason that increasing the duration (shaking for a longer time) will lead to more pieces breaking off. This outcome is due to the extended application of the physical forces involved, not due to temperature changes, water properties, or chemical reactions that might cause color changes."
