Question: Which example describes a behavioral adaptation?
Options: ['A bird builds its nest in the ash near a volcano.', 'A whale has the ability to hold its breath for 20 minutes.', "A fox's hair is white in the winter and brown in the summer.", 'A monkey has long arms that allow it to swing from one branch to another.']
Answer: A bird builds its nest in the ash near a volcano.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "A bird builds its nest in the ash near a volcano.",
    "reasoning": "This example describes a behavioral adaptation because the bird chooses a specific location for nesting based on environmental conditions, which is a change in behavior rather than a physical feature of the bird. The other options describe physical adaptations: the whale's breath-holding ability, the fox's seasonal fur color change, and the monkey's long arms for swinging."
