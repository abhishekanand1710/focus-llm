Model Answer: {
    "answer": "March 21",
    "reasoning": "Since the student observed that the Moon could not be seen on February 21, this indicates a New Moon phase, marking the start of a new lunar cycle. Given that the lunar cycle lasts about 29.5 days, the next similar phase when the Moon will be not visible again due to the New Moon would be approximately 29.5 days later. Calculating 29.5 days from February 21 lands us around March 21, allowing for the slight variation due to the cycle's length and calendar days. Therefore, the most accurate guess from the provided options for when the Moon will not be visible again in the clear night sky is March 21."
