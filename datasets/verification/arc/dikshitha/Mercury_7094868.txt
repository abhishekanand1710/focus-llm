Key: Mercury_7094868

Question: When gasoline in a car engine is burned, only about 15 percent of the gasoline is converted into mechanical energy. This is because most of the energy in the gasoline is
Options: ['transformed into heat.', 'stored for use at a later time.', 'changed into chemical energy.', 'used to make the vehicle move.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "transformed into heat.",
    "reasoning": "The question highlights that only about 15 percent of the gasoline's energy is converted into mechanical energy, implying the majority is lost in another form. The concepts and relationships identified explain that the combustion of gasoline in a car engine converts chemical energy into mechanical energy and heat. However, a significant amount of this energy conversion results in heat, which is not directly used for vehicle movement and is essentially considered 'lost' or 'wasted' energy in the context of propulsion. Hence, the correct option is that most of the energy in the gasoline is transformed into heat, which aligns with the understanding of energy conversion efficiency in internal combustion engines."
