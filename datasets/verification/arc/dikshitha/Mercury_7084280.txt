Question: A student observes zinc turning from a solid to a liquid in a laboratory investigation. Which statement describes the change in zinc atoms while melting?
Options: ['The mass of the zinc atoms decreased.', 'The zinc atoms lost their relative fixed position.', 'The zinc atoms were changed into atoms of another element.', 'The size of the zinc atoms decreased.']
Answer: The zinc atoms lost their relative fixed position.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The zinc atoms lost their relative fixed position.",
    "reasoning": "During the melting process, zinc transitions from a solid to a liquid state. This change is characterized by zinc atoms losing their relatively fixed positions, allowing them to move more freely relative to each other, which is a fundamental aspect of the liquid state. The options regarding the mass decrease, transformation into another element, or atom size decrease are inaccurate descriptions of melting. The substance keeps its mass, chemical identity, and the atomic size remains essentially unchanged during this phase change. Therefore, the correct understanding of melting in this context is related to the change in the spatial arrangement of atoms."
