    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the Sun",
    "reasoning": "The Sun is the primary source of light and heat for Earth, essential for maintaining the planet's temperature and supporting life. While other options like fire, lightning, and the ocean do involve heat transfer, they are either localized phenomena or play a role in distributing rather than generating the planet's primary heat source. Thus, the Sun is the main source of heat for Earth's surface, as it emits light and heat that warms the planet."
