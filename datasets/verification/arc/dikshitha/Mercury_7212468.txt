Model Answer: {
    "answer": "size of the object being attracted by the core",
    "reasoning": "The strength of an electromagnet is determined by the number of coils, the type, and the amount of material in the core, not by the size of the object being attracted. The size of the attracted object does not influence the electromagnet's ability to generate a magnetic field, making it the correct answer."
