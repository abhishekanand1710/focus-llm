Model Answer: {
    "answer": "performing each step quickly",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, 'performing each step quickly' contradicts the principles of laboratory safety. Effective laboratory practice requires careful attention to detail and not rushing through the procedures to minimize the risk of accidents and ensure accuracy. The other options listed (tying back long hair, wearing safety goggles, and wiping up spills immediately) are all recognized safe practices aimed at preventing accidents and exposure to hazardous materials."
