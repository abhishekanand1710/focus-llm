Model Answer: {
    "answer": "gravity",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, gravity is the only force that acts between all masses in the universe to attract them toward each other. The Moon orbits the Earth due to the Earth's gravitational pull on the Moon. The concept of gravity accurately explains how bodies like the Earth and the Moon are kept in their orbits, while lunar phases, magnetism, and ocean tides are consequences of this gravitational relationship but do not themselves keep the Moon in orbit."
