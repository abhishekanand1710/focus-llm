Key: Mercury_7005408

Question: A student uses a pH meter to measure the acidity of a water sample from a lake. For what purpose is the student most likely testing the water?
Options: ['to learn what organisms could survive in the lake', 'to determine the age of the lake', 'to understand how people use the lake', 'to find out the depth of the lake']
Answer: to learn what organisms could survive in the lake

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "to learn what organisms could survive in the lake",
    "reasoning": "The student is using a pH meter to measure the acidity of a water sample from a lake, which suggests the primary interest is in the aquatic environment's conditions. The acidity or alkalinity of the water is a significant determinant of what types of organisms can thrive in it. The pH level affects the survivability and health of aquatic life; thus, understanding it helps in assessing which organisms can survive in the lake. The other options, such as determining the lake's age, its usage by people, or finding out the lake's depth, are not directly related to the measurement of water's acidity with a pH meter."
