Question: During a sporting event, a referee uses a whistle to alert the teams to start and stop playing. What causes the sound from the referee's whistle to travel in all directions?
Options: ['vibrations on the ground', 'vibrations of the air', 'seismic waves', 'light waves']
Answer: vibrations of the air

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "vibrations of the air",
    "reasoning": "The sound from the referee's whistle travels in all directions due to the vibrations of the air. The act of blowing into the whistle produces sound by causing the air inside and around the whistle to vibrate. These vibrations spread outwards in all directions as sound waves, making it possible for the sound to be heard by players and spectators alike. This process aligns with the concepts and relationships identified, highlighting how sound is generated and propagated through air vibrations."
