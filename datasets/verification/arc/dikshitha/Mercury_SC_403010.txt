Model Answer: {
    "answer": "wire and battery",
    "reasoning": "A simple circuit needs a minimum of a power source and a conductor to create a complete path for electrical flow. A 'battery' acts as the power source, while 'wire' serves as the conductor to connect components and close the circuit. Without a battery, there's no power source to drive the circuit, and without wire, there's no means to connect components and allow current to flow. Hence, options including both light bulbs and switches, while useful for specific functions (light emission and control of current flow respectively), are not necessary for the most basic functionality of a circuit which is to demonstrate a complete path for current flow. Therefore, 'wire and battery' are the essential components needed to create a simple circuit."
