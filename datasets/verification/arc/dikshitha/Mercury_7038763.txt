Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They are solids at room temperature.",
    "reasoning": "The elements found on the left side of the Periodic Table are predominantly metals, which are typically known for being solid at room temperature, conducting electricity well, and not being universally radioactive or exclusively brittle and dull, qualities more associated with non-metals or other specific groups of elements. Among the provided options, 'They are solids at room temperature.' is the property that most accurately and universally applies to elements on the left side of the Periodic Table."
