Question: Using nonrenewable resources for energy produces waste products that can have long-term, negative effects on Earth's subsystems. Which energy source produces waste products that can have these effects for the longest amount of time?
Options: ['natural gas', 'uranium', 'crude oil', 'coal']
Answer: uranium

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "uranium",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, uranium is used as fuel in nuclear power plants, wherein its waste products include radioactive material that remains hazardous for thousands of years, far longer than the waste produced by burning natural gas, crude oil, or coal. Thus, uranium produces waste products that can have negative effects on Earth's subsystems for the longest amount of time."
