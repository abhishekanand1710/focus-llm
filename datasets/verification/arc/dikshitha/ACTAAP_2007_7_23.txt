    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "global warming",
    "reasoning": "Global warming refers to the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system, which is directly related to the provided context of a 'worldwide increase in temperature'. It is primarily a result of the greenhouse effect, where gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, leading to an increase in global temperatures. The other options do not directly define a worldwide increase in temperature: the greenhouse effect is a process that contributes to global warming, ozone depletion is a distinct atmospheric issue that affects ultraviolet radiation absorption, and solar heating is a component of the natural heating of the Earth's surface and atmosphere."
