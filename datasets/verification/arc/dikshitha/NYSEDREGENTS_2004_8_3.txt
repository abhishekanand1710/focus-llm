        "description": "Transporting materials such as oxygen, nutrients, and hormones is a key function of the circulatory system."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "transport materials",
    "reasoning": "The main function of the circulatory system is to transport materials throughout the body, including oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products. This is fundamental for maintaining homeostasis and enabling various bodily functions to occur. While secreting enzymes and producing hormones are important biological functions, they are primarily associated with the digestive and endocrine systems, respectively, rather than the circulatory system."
