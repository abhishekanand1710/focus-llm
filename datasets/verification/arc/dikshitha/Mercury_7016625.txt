Model Answer: {
    "answer": "sediments.",
    "reasoning": "Weathering and erosion are processes that break down rocks and transport these materials, forming sediments. This is a direct relationship where the physical and chemical breakdown of rocks (weathering) and the movement of these broken pieces (erosion) result in the accumulation of sediment. The other options, such as magma, minerals, and crystals, do not start their formation process directly through weathering and erosion."
