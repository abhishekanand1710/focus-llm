    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "orbital path",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, the Sun's gravitational force primarily influences the orbital path of the planets in our Solar System. This force maintains the planets in their orbital trajectories around the Sun and is the key determining factor of how the planets orbit. Although axial tilt, the masses of the planets, and the number of moons per planet are important characteristics of the planets, they are not directly influenced by the Sun's gravitational force as much as the orbital path is."
