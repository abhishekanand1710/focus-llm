Question: Approximately 59% of the Moon is visible from Earth because the Moon rotates and revolves in the same period. Which most likely causes this phenomenon?
Options: ['the gravitational pull of the Sun', 'the gravitational pull of Earth', 'the composition of the Moon', 'the phases of the Moon']
Answer: the gravitational pull of Earth

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the gravitational pull of Earth",
    "reasoning": "The observable phenomenon that approximately 59% of the Moon is visible from Earth is a result of synchronous rotation, which itself is caused by the gravitational pull of Earth on the Moon. This gravitational influence results in the Moon's rotational period matching its orbital period around Earth, allowing a greater than half portion of the Moon's surface to be observable over time due to oscillation effects such as libration. The other options, including the gravitational pull of the Sun, the composition of the Moon, and the phases of the Moon, do not directly cause this synchronous rotation or the percentage of the Moon visible from Earth."
