    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "oxygen",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, Oxygen is the most common element found in the compounds that make up ocean water, primarily due to its presence in water (H2O), which is the most abundant molecule in the ocean. The other elements like nitrogen, carbon, and silicon are also present in ocean water but in lesser quantities compared to oxygen."
