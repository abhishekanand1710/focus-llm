Model Answer: {
    "answer": "cardiovascular and muscular",
    "reasoning": "The Respiratory System requires the Cardiovascular System to transport oxygen to the cells and remove carbon dioxide from the body. The Muscular System is essential for the process of breathing, which involves the inhalation of oxygen and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Thus, both the Cardiovascular and Muscular systems are indispensable for the Respiratory System to deliver oxygen and remove carbon dioxide."
