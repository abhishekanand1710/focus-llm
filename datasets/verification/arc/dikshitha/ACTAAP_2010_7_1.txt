        "description": "Over time, solar energy can be one of the most cost-effective forms of energy, but its initial setup cost and the variability in its efficiency based on location and weather conditions make this a nuanced issue"
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The supply of solar energy will not change for billions of years.",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, the most accurate difference of solar energy compared to other energy types is its virtually inexhaustible supply over a timespan of billions of years. This is derived from the expected lifespan of the Sun, making solar energy a sustainable and long-term source of power. Other options presented misconceptions or incomplete assessments about solar energy, such as the involvement of dangerous equipment or overly complicated technology, and the assumption that it is the cheapest kind of energy without considering various factors such as initial setup costs and maintenance."
