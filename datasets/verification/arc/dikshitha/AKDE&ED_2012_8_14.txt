Question: A person cuts down a living oak tree. The person burns the wood from the oak tree to boil water. Which sequence correctly orders the energy transformations that occurred from the living tree to the boiling of water?
Options: ['light energy → chemical energy → thermal energy', 'thermal energy → chemical energy → light energy', 'chemical energy → mechanical energy → electrical energy', 'electrical energy → mechanical energy → chemical energy']
Answer: light energy → chemical energy → thermal energy

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "light energy \u2192 chemical energy \u2192 thermal energy",
    "reasoning": "Initially, the oak tree absorbs light energy from the sun and stores it as chemical energy in its structure. When the tree is cut down and its wood is burned, this stored chemical energy is released as thermal energy. The thermal energy then is used to heat and boil water. Therefore, the sequence of energy transformations from the living tree to the boiling of water is from light energy, to chemical energy, and finally to thermal energy."
