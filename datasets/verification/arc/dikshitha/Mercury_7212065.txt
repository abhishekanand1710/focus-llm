Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The molecules move slower and occupy less space.",
    "reasoning": "As water changes state from steam (gaseous state) to liquid water, the motion of the water molecules decreases since the kinetic energy of the molecules decreases. Additionally, the molecules occupy less space as they transition from a gaseous state with molecules far apart to a liquid state where the molecules are much closer together. The relationships outlined show that the transition from steam to liquid water is characterized by a decrease in both the motion of molecules and the space they occupy."
