Question: Some plants, like redwood trees, may live for thousands of years. Some plants, like the black-eyed Susan wildflower, may only live a few weeks. What would these plants most likely have in common in order to survive?
Options: ['using cones for spreading seeds', 'a successful way to reproduce', 'the ability to live in the desert', 'thorns to keep away animals']
Answer: a successful way to reproduce

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a successful way to reproduce",
    "reasoning": "Despite the vast differences in lifespan and habitat between redwood trees and black-eyed Susan wildflowers, the fundamental requirement for the survival of any plant species is a successful way to reproduce. Reproduction ensures the continuation of the species, by either spreading seeds effectively or through other reproductive strategies. The other options, such as using cones for spreading seeds, living in the desert, or having thorns to keep away animals, are specific strategies that are not universally applicable to all plants for survival and reproduction. However, having a successful way to reproduce is a common essential requirement for the continuation of species, which directly affects their survival and longevity."
