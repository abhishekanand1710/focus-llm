Question: A pharmaceutical company develops a new antibiotic to treat pneumonia. After limited testing, the researchers conclude that the antibiotic seems to be effective. How can the researchers strengthen their conclusions?
Options: ['Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.', 'Publish their results in a medical journal.', 'Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.', 'Test the effectiveness of the antibiotic at killing other bacteria.']
Answer: Ask an independent lab to retest the antibiotic.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Test the antibiotic on human volunteers.",
    "reasoning": "Testing the antibiotic on human volunteers directly addresses the question of whether the antibiotic is effective in treating pneumonia in humans. It provides the most relevant data on its efficacy and safety in the intended patient population, thereby strongly strengthening the researchers' conclusions about its effectiveness against pneumonia. While other options such as publishing results or testing on other bacteria might provide additional supportive information or validate findings, they do not directly enhance the understanding of the effectiveness of the antibiotic in treating human pneumonia as much as clinical trials involving human participants would."
