    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Carbon can form many types of molecules with covalent bonds.",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, the central role of carbon in the chemistry of living organisms is best described by its ability to form a wide variety of molecules through covalent bonding. This is due to its four valence electrons, which enable it to form strong covalent bonds with many other elements, including other carbon atoms, thus resulting in a vast diversity of organic compounds. This characteristic is fundamental to the structure and function of macromolecules essential for life."
