Model Answer: {
    "answer": "reading",
    "reasoning": "Based on the relationships identified, the invention of the light bulb has the most significant impact on reading. This is because the light bulb provides the necessary illumination to see and read written materials in environments where natural light is inadequate or unavailable. Whereas activities like swimming, walking, and talking are less dependent on artificial light for their execution, making reading the most affected and benefited by the invention of the light bulb."
