        "related_concept": "46",
        "description": "Humans have 46 chromosomes in diploid cells, including most body cells."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "23",
    "reasoning": "A human sperm cell is a haploid cell resulting from the meiosis process, which halves the diploid number of chromosomes. Since humans have 46 chromosomes in their diploid cells, this number is divided by two during the formation of sperm, resulting in 23 chromosomes in a sperm cell."
