Question: A bowling ball with a mass of 8.0 kg rolls down a bowling lane at 2.0 m/s. What is the momentum of the bowling ball?
Options: ['4.0 kg x m/s', '6.0 kg x m/s', '10.0 kg x m/s', '16.0 kg x m/s']
Answer: 16.0 kg x m/s

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "16.0 kg x m/s",
    "reasoning": "The momentum of the bowling ball is calculated by multiplying its mass (8.0 kg) by its velocity (2.0 m/s), which results in 8.0 kg * 2.0 m/s = 16.0 kg x m/s. Therefore, among the given options, '16.0 kg x m/s' is the correct answer."
