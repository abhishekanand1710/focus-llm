Question: As a heavy metal ball rolls down a hill, it goes faster and faster. Which statement is true?
Options: ["The ball's potential energy is changing to kinetic energy.", 'The ball is gaining potential energy from the hill.', 'The ball is rapidly losing kinetic energy as it rolls down the hill.', 'The ball will continue gaining kinetic energy until it stops.']
Answer: The ball's potential energy is changing to kinetic energy.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The ball's potential energy is changing to kinetic energy.",
    "reasoning": "As the heavy metal ball rolls down the hill, it converts its potential energy, which is high at the top of the hill due to its elevated position, into kinetic energy, which increases as the ball accelerates downhill. This conversion from potential to kinetic energy is the reason why the ball goes faster and faster."
