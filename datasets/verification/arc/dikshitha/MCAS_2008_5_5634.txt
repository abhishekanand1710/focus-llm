    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "to find an environment with more food",
    "reasoning": "Birds in New England fly south for the winter months primarily to find environments where food sources remain abundant. The decrease in food availability in New England during the winter due to harsh weather conditions and the consequent scarcity of insects, seeds, and fruits compel birds to migrate to warmer regions where these resources are more plentiful."
