Question: A student pushes against a tree with a force of 10 newtons (N). The tree does not move. What is the amount of force exerted by the tree on the student?
Options: ['0 N', '5 N', '10 N', '20 N']
Answer: 10 N

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "10 N",
    "reasoning": "According to Newton's Third Law of Motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if the student exerts a force of 10 N against the tree, the tree exerts an equal and opposite force of 10 N against the student. The concept of static equilibrium supports this as well, indicating that the forces are balanced since the tree does not move. Therefore, the force exerted by the tree on the student is 10 N."
