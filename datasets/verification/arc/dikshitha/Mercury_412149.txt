Model Answer: {
    "answer": "K.",
    "reasoning": "Both Sodium (Na) and Potassium (K) are in the same group on the periodic table; they are both Alkali Metals. This group is characterized by similar properties including being shiny and highly reactive. Unlike Magnesium (Mg) and Calcium (Ca), which are Alkaline Earth Metals, and Neon (Ne), which is a Noble Gas, Potassium shares the closest chemical properties with Sodium, making it the only correct match from the options provided."
