]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "solar-collection panels",
    "reasoning": "Out of the provided options, solar-collection panels are directly associated with reducing a school's consumption of nonrenewable resources by generating electricity through sunlight, a renewable resource. This directly diminishes the school's reliance on nonrenewable energy sources like fossil fuels, in contrast to the other options which either consume more energy, do not directly impact energy consumption, or affect waste management rather than energy consumption."
