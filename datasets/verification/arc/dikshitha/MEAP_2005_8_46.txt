Question: The depth of Lake Superior can be measured by sending sound waves to the bottom and measuring the period of time it takes for the reflected sound waves to return to the surface. Which of the following would indicate a shallow depth?
Options: ['There is no return signal.', 'The return signal is very weak.', 'The return signal appears almost instantaneously.', 'The return signal comes back at a different speed']
Answer: The return signal appears almost instantaneously.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The return signal appears almost instantaneously.",
    "reasoning": "When sound waves are used to measure the depth of a body of water like Lake Superior, the period it takes for the reflected sound waves (return signal) to come back to the surface indicates the depth. A shallow depth means the sound waves do not have to travel very far before reflecting back to the surface. Therefore, if a return signal appears almost instantaneously, this indicates a shallow depth because the sound waves travelled a short distance, reflected off the bottom, and returned quickly."
