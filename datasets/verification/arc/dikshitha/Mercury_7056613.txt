Key: Mercury_7056613

Question: When a car engine is started, gasoline is mixed with air and burned. Heat, sound, and chemical products are released. As the engine operates, which of these remains constant?
Options: ['the masses of compounds found in the engine', 'the amount of heat in the engine', 'the total mass of gasoline', 'the total amount of energy']
Answer: the total amount of energy

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the total amount of energy",
    "reasoning": "Based on the principle of energy conservation, in an isolated system, the total amount of energy remains constant. Despite the transformation of energy forms (from chemical energy in gasoline to heat, sound, and kinetic energy) within the engine, the overall energy of the system does not change. The other options (mass of compounds, the amount of heat, and the total mass of gasoline) can vary during the operation of an engine through consumption and transformation processes."
