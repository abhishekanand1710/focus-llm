Question: Dr. Tanaka discovered a new virus. The virus has a single strand of a nucleic acid, but she does not know if it is DNA or RNA. After running tests, she concludes that it is DNA. Which of the following would lead her to that conclusion?
Options: ['It contains uracil.', 'It contains adenine.', 'It contains thymine.', 'It contains cytosine.']
Answer: It contains thymine.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It contains thymine.",
    "reasoning": "The presence of thymine in the nucleic acid structure is a clear indicator that the virus's genetic material is DNA and not RNA, as RNA contains uracil instead of thymine. Thymine exclusively pairs with adenine in DNA, while RNA uses uracil to pair with adenine. Therefore, discovering thymine among the virus's nucleic acids led Dr. Tanaka to the conclusion that it is DNA."
