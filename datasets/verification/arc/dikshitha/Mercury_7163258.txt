Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Antler growth is controlled by genes.",
    "reasoning": "The development of antlers in male whitetail deer but not in females is best explained by genetic factors. Both male and female deer possess the genes for antler growth, but these genes are expressed primarily in males due to the influence of sex hormones. The rarity of female deer with antlers further supports the idea that the presence or absence of antlers is a trait controlled by genetics rather than age, necessity for antlers, or behavior."
