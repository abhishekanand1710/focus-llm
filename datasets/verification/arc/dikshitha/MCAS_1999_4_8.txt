Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a plastic spoon",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, the items made from materials grown in nature include a cotton shirt (made from cotton), a wooden chair (made from wood), and a grass basket (made from grass). However, a plastic spoon is made from plastic, which is derived from petroleum and not grown in nature. This makes the plastic spoon the correct answer as it is not made from a material that is naturally grown."
