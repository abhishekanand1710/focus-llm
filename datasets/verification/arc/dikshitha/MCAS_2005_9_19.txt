Question: A student is standing on a skateboard that is not moving. The total mass of the student and the skateboard is 50 kilograms. The student throws a ball with a mass of 2 kilograms forward at 5 m/s. Assuming the skateboard wheels are frictionless, how will the student and the skateboard move?
Options: ['forward at 0.4 m/s', 'forward at 5 m/s', 'backward at 0.2 m/s', 'backward at 5 m/s']
Answer: backward at 5 m/s

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "backward at 0.2 m/s",
    "reasoning": "Given the conservation of momentum and the absence of external forces (due to frictionless wheels), the momentum before and after throwing the ball must be equal. Initially, the system is at rest, so its total momentum is 0. When the student throws the ball forward at 5 m/s, the momentum of the ball is (2 kg)(5 m/s) = 10 kg*m/s forward. For momentum to be conserved, the student and skateboard must move backward with equal momentum but in the opposite direction. Since the total mass of the student and skateboard is 50 kg, to achieve a momentum of -10 kg*m/s, their velocity must be (momentum) / (mass) = (-10 kg*m/s) / (50 kg) = -0.2 m/s. Therefore, the student and skateboard move backward at 0.2 m/s."
