Model Answer: {
    "answer": "an instinctive behavior.",
    "reasoning": "The annual migration of green sea turtles spanning approximately 2000 km to reproduce is classified as 'an instinctive behavior' because it is an innate activity. They undertake this journey not as a learned response or as a reaction to external conditions like crowding or escaping predators but are driven by instinct to return to their breeding grounds to reproduce. This behavior is ingrained and does not require the turtles to learn it from experience."
