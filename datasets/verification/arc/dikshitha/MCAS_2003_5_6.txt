    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "color",
    "reasoning": "Since both rocks are made up entirely of the same mineral, it is most likely that their color will be the same. This is because the color of a rock is primarily determined by its mineral composition. While size, shape, and weight can vary significantly even among rocks composed of the same minerals, color is a property directly tied to the chemical and physical characteristics of the mineral(s) present."
