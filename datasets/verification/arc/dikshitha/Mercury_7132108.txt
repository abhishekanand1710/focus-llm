Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a nail being hammered",
    "reasoning": "Of the given options, 'a nail being hammered' best represents the use of mechanical energy, as it directly involves converting mechanical energy (motion of the hammer) into work (driving the nail into another material). This process aligns with the definition of mechanical energy, which is the energy of an object or system due to its motion or position. The other options involve processes that mainly convert other forms of energy into light, heat, or involve chemical reactions, rather than the direct application of mechanical energy."
