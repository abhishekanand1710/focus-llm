Question: Rolando wants to see at what temperature various liquids boil. He boils tap water and records the temperature. He then boils tap water with milk added and tap water with sugar added. What is the purpose of boiling plain tap water first?
Options: ['to include a factor to manipulate', 'to have a possible explanation to a problem', 'to change one variable while observing the others', 'to provide a standard by which to compare the results']
Answer: to provide a standard by which to compare the results

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "to provide a standard by which to compare the results",
    "reasoning": "Boiling plain tap water first allows Rolando to establish a control or baseline (the boiling point of plain tap water) against which he can compare the effects of added substances, such as milk or sugar. This comparison is essential to understanding how these additions change the boiling point of the water."
