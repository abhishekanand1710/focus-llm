Question: Which is true about reproduction for both an amoeba and a paramecium?
Options: ['Both can conjugate.', 'Neither can conjugate.', 'An amoeba can conjugate, but a paramecium cannot.', 'A paramecium can conjugate, but an amoeba cannot.']
Answer: A paramecium can conjugate, but an amoeba cannot.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "A paramecium can conjugate, but an amoeba cannot.",
    "reasoning": "From the defined relationships and concepts, it's evident that paramecium have the ability to engage in conjugation, a form of sexual reproduction, allowing for the exchange of genetic material between individuals. On the other hand, amoebas solely reproduce asexually through binary fission without engaging in conjugation. Therefore, the statement that 'a paramecium can conjugate, but an amoeba cannot' is true based on their reproductive capabilities."
