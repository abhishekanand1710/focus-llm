    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "gene expression",
    "reasoning": "The attachment of methyl radicals, or methyl groups, to genes plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. This process affects how genes are turned on or off without altering the DNA sequence itself, influencing the synthesis of proteins based on the genetic information contained within the genes. It does not directly impact the information genes store, the mode of gene inheritance, or the gene coding system but rather how the expression of genes is controlled, thereby affecting protein synthesis and cell function."
