Question: Spirogyra are green algae that can reproduce sexually. Which of the following features identifies reproduction in Spirogyra as sexual reproduction?
Options: ['The cells of parent algae have nuclei.', 'Each offspring contains chloroplasts.', 'Several offspring may be produced at once.', 'Genetic material is contributed by two parent cells.']
Answer: Genetic material is contributed by two parent cells.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "'Genetic material is contributed by two parent cells.'",
    "reasoning": "The key characteristic that identifies reproduction in Spirogyra as sexual reproduction is the contribution of genetic material by two parent cells. This is a defining feature of sexual reproduction, involving the combination of genetic material from two different individuals to produce genetically distinct offspring. The presence of nuclei, chloroplasts in offspring, or the production of several offspring at once are all aspects that can occur in both sexual and asexual reproduction and do not specifically identify sexual reproduction."
