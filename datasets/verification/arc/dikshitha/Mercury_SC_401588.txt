Key: Mercury_SC_401588

Question: A student is given three identically sized blocks. Each block is made of a different material. What characteristic of the blocks should be examined to find out which block is made of metal?
Options: ['color', 'weight', 'texture', 'conductivity']
Answer: conductivity

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "conductivity",
    "reasoning": "Among color, weight, texture, and conductivity, the characteristic that most uniquely identifies a block as made of metal is conductivity. Metals are known for their exceptionally high electrical and thermal conductivity compared to other materials like wood or plastic. While metals can vary in color, weight, and texture, these properties are not as uniquely distinguishing as the ability to conduct electricity, which is a defining property of metals."
