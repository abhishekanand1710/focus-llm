Question: From Earth, we see the sun in the day sky and other stars in the night sky. Nighttime stars look like tiny points of light. Which statement explains why nighttime stars appear so much smaller than the sun?
Options: ['The stars are much smaller.', 'The sky is much darker at night.', 'The stars are much farther away.', 'The moon blocks out most starlight.']
Answer: The stars are much farther away.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The stars are much farther away.",
    "reasoning": "The primary reason nighttime stars appear so much smaller than the Sun is due to their immense distance from Earth. Despite being similar in nature to the Sun, which is also a star, other stars are located much farther away in the universe. This vast distance makes them appear as tiny points of light in the night sky, in contrast to the Sun, which is relatively close to Earth and thus appears large and bright. The relationships between Earth, the Sun, stars, and the concept of distance help explain this difference in apparent size."
