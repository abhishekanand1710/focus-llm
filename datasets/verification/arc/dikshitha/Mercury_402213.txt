Question: Which of these does not illustrate substances reacting to form new substances?
Options: ['H_{2}O(l) -> H_{2}O(g)', '2H_{2} + O_{2} -> 2H_{2}O', '2Na + Cl_{2} -> 2NaCl', '6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2}']
Answer: H_{2}O(l) -> H_{2}O(g)

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "'H_{2}O(l) -> H_{2}O(g)'",
    "reasoning": "The given options illustrate various processes. The conversion of water (H2O) from liquid (l) to gas (g) state represents a physical change, specifically a state change, rather than a chemical reaction where substances react to form new substances. The other options describe chemical reactions where new substances are indeed formed: 2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O is a combination reaction forming water from hydrogen and oxygen, 2Na + Cl2 -> 2NaCl describes the formation of sodium chloride from sodium and chlorine, and 6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2 represents the photosynthesis process producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water."
