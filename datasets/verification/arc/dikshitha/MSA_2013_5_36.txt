Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the revolution of Earth around the sun",
    "reasoning": "An Earth year is defined by the time it takes for Earth to complete one revolution around the Sun. This relationship and the concept of revolution directly relate to understanding what an Earth year entails, distinguishing it from Earth's rotation or any motion of the Sun around Earth."
