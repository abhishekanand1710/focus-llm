Question: Students recorded the initial and final temperatures of different-colored soils exposed to direct sunlight for three hours. The students want to compare the total temperature change for each soil color. Which of these formats would be the most appropriate for displaying the results of this investigation?
Options: ['bar graph', 'line graph', 'pie chart', 'data table']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "bar graph",
    "reasoning": "A bar graph is the most appropriate format for displaying the results of the investigation because it effectively compares the magnitude of temperature changes for each soil color visually. It represents each soil color as a different bar, making it easy to compare the total temperature change directly and visually amongst the soil colors. Unlike line graphs, which are better for showing trends over time, or pie charts, which are ideal for representing parts of a whole, bar graphs excel at comparing individual categories, in this case, soil colors, on a given metric, such as temperature change. Data tables are also useful for recording the exact measurements but do not visually compare the results as effectively as a bar graph."
