Question: Soils change both through natural processes and as a result of human activity. Which of the following soil changes is due only to natural causes?
Options: ['degradation of nutrients due to pesticides', 'formation of deserts due to tree felling', 'flooding due to dam construction', 'removal of nutrients due to heavy rains']
Answer: removal of nutrients due to heavy rains

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "removal of nutrients due to heavy rains",
    "reasoning": "Of the options provided, the 'removal of nutrients due to heavy rains' is the only soil change occurring due to natural causes without direct human intervention. Heavy rains naturally lead to soil nutrient depletion via leaching, contrasting with the other options which are consequences of human activities (using pesticides, felling trees, and constructing dams)."
