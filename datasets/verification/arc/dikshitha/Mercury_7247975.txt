Model Answer: {
    "answer": "opening a drawer",
    "reasoning": "Opening a drawer best models the motion of an arm at the elbow joint as it directly involves the flexion and extension of the elbow, closely mimicking the natural movement range and mechanics of the elbow joint. Unlike the other options, opening a drawer encapsulates the essential motion of bending and straightening at the elbow which is intrinsic to how the elbow joint functions."
