Question: Why do scientists perform multiple trials of the same experiment?
Options: ['to include additional variables in the experiment', 'to complete the steps of the experiment in less time', 'to find a less expensive way to conduct the experiment', 'to increase the likelihood of accurate experiment results']
Answer: to increase the likelihood of accurate experiment results

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "to increase the likelihood of accurate experiment results",
    "reasoning": "Scientists perform multiple trials of the same experiment primarily to ensure that their results are accurate and reliable. This process helps to eliminate outliers, reduce the effects of random errors, and confirm that the experimental outcomes are repeatable under the same conditions. Unlike the other options, the goal of conducting multiple trials is not to introduce new variables, increase efficiency, or reduce costs, but to improve the reliability and validity of the experimental results."
