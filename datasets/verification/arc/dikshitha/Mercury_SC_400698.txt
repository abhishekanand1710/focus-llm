    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Potential energy is changed to kinetic energy.",
    "reasoning": "The operation of a remote control toy involves converting the chemical energy stored in a battery into kinetic energy, which is the energy of movement that powers the toy. While the chemical energy could be seen as a form of potential energy in this context, it is more directly and accurately characterized as a conversion from chemical energy to kinetic energy. The other options, such as converting heat to light or kinetic energy directly to chemical energy, do not accurately describe the process that occurs in the operation of a remote control toy."
