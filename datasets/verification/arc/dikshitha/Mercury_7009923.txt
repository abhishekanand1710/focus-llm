    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the removal of underground resources",
    "reasoning": "Sinkholes often form as a result of the removal of underground resources which can create voids or cavities. When the support for the land above these voids weakens, it can collapse, forming a sinkhole. This process is more relevant to the formation of sinkholes than tectonic plate collisions, dense rock formations under the topsoil, or the buildup of sediment on the ocean floor."
