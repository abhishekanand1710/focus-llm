Model Answer: {
    "answer": "1,200 grams",
    "reasoning": "The mass of the solid lemonade would be the sum of the mass of the lemon juice (100 grams), the sugar (100 grams), and the water (1,000 grams) because mass is conserved when substances are mixed together. Hence, the total mass of the solid lemonade is 1,200 grams."
