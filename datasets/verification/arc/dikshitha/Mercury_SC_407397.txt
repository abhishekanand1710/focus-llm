Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Record the appearance of the crops before fertilizing.",
    "reasoning": "Recording the appearance of the crops before any intervention provides a baseline for comparison. This method allows the farmer to assess the specific impact of adding fertilizer on the health and growth of his crops, by comparing their condition before and after fertilization. It is a crucial first step to scientifically evaluate the effectiveness of adding fertilizer."
