Model Answer: {
    "answer": "have high winds",
    "reasoning": "Based on the concepts and their relationships identified, both hurricanes and tornadoes are characterized by having high winds. While hurricanes can cause flooding and are often hundreds of miles wide, and tornadoes could potentially contribute to flooding but are not hundreds of miles wide, the commonality that pertains to both entities and directly matches one of the provided options is the characteristic of having high winds."
