Question: Drew knows that Earth is tilted on its axis. He also knows this tilt is responsible for the season that a region on Earth will experience. When the South Pole is tilted toward the Sun, what season will it be in Florida?
Options: ['fall', 'spring', 'summer', 'winter']
Answer: winter

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "winter",
    "reasoning": "When the South Pole is tilted towards the Sun, it indicates that the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing its summer season due to receiving more direct sunlight. Given that the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere, and since Florida is located in the Northern Hemisphere, it will be experiencing winter at this time."
