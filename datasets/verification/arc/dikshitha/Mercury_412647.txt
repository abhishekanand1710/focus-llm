Model Answer: {
    "answer": "5",
    "reasoning": "In one formula unit of magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2, there is one magnesium (Mg) atom, and two hydroxide (OH) groups. Since each hydroxide group consists of one oxygen (O) atom and one hydrogen (H) atom, the total atom count is 1 Mg + (2 * (1 O + 1 H)) = 1 Mg + 2 O + 2 H = 5 atoms."
