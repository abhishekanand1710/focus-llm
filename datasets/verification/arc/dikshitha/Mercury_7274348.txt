Question: Which of these is one similarity of the elements in the first group of the periodic table?
Options: ['The elements in the group have similar atomic masses.', 'The elements in the group have the same number of electrons.', 'The elements in the group are very unreactive metals.', 'The elements in the group react with oxygen in similar ways.']
Answer: The elements in the group react with oxygen in similar ways.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The elements in the group react with oxygen in similar ways.",
    "reasoning": "Elements in the first group of the periodic table, alkali metals, are characterized by their high reactivity, particularly with oxygen, leading them to form oxides in similar manners. This similarity in reaction with oxygen is a distinctive characteristic of this group, differentiating it from the other options which do not universally apply to all members of the group."
