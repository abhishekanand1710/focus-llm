    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "skin",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, the skin of a frog has a function most similar to the lungs in a bird, as it participates in gas exchange, allowing the frog to breathe through it, much like birds use their lungs for breathing and gas exchange with the environment."
