Question: Secondary succession is a process that reestablishes a previously colonized, but disturbed or damaged habitat. Which will most likely result in colonization by large herbivores and carnivores?
Options: ['saplings and trees', 'grasses and shrubs', 'lichens and mosses', 'seedlings and bushes']
Answer: saplings and trees

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "saplings and trees",
    "reasoning": "The colonization by large herbivores and carnivores most likely results from the development of a habitat with 'saplings and trees.' This stage of secondary succession provides the necessary resources (in terms of habitat and food) for large herbivores. These in turn attract carnivores, making a mature ecosystem with 'saplings and trees' the stage at which these animals are most likely to be found."
