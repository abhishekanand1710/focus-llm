Model Answer: {
    "answer": "planting crops that survive in droughts",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, planting crops that survive in droughts directly contributes to conserving water by utilizing plants that require less water, thus reducing water usage. The other options describe activities that waste water and are contrary to the principle of water conservation."
