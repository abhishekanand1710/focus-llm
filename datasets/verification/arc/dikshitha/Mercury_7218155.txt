Question: In the 1500s, Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a new theory on the heliocentric structure of the solar system. Which of these statements best describes this new theory?
Options: ['Earth is at the center of the solar system.', 'There are eight planets in the solar system.', 'The Sun is at the center of the solar system.', 'Moons have circular orbits in the solar system.']
Answer: The Sun is at the center of the solar system.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The Sun is at the center of the solar system.",
    "reasoning": "According to Nicolaus Copernicus' heliocentric theory, he proposed that the Sun is at the center of the solar system, which contrasts with the previously held belief that the Earth was the center. This theory redefined the understanding of the solar system's structure by suggesting that planets, including Earth, orbit around the Sun. Therefore, the statement that best describes Nicolaus Copernicus' new theory from the given options is that 'The Sun is at the center of the solar system.'"
