Question: A carpenter covered a piece of wood with a thin sheet of paper. He struck the covered piece of wood with a hammer. The impact left a small hole in the paper that smelled of smoke. Which kind of energy transfer did this event most likely demonstrate?
Options: ['chemical to thermal', 'mechanical to thermal', 'mechanical to chemical', 'chemical to mechanical']
Answer: mechanical to thermal

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "mechanical to thermal",
    "reasoning": "The process described involves the transformation of mechanical energy from the hammer strike into thermal energy, as evidenced by the generation of heat (indicated by the smell of smoke) and the creation of a small hole in the paper. This transformation illustrates how kinetic energy (a form of mechanical energy) can be converted into thermal energy through the process of impact and the subsequent heat generation."
