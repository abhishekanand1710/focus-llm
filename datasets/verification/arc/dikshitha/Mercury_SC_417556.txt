Model Answer: {
    "answer": "feeders on the side of the road",
    "reasoning": "Placing feeders on the side of the road would not help protect deer from cars; instead, it might attract deer to the roadside, increasing the likelihood of collisions with vehicles. Unlike lights, which illuminate the area for better visibility of deer, signs that warn drivers to be cautious, and bridges that provide safe passage for deer over or under the road without crossing it directly, feeders could inadvertently lead deer into dangerous proximity with road traffic."
