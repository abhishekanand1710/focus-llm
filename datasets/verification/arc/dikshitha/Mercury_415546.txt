    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Niobium is an element.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the provided chemical symbol Nb, which represents a specific chemical element, it can be concluded that Niobium is not a compound, metal (in the general sense without more context), or mixture, but rather an element. This is affirmed by the nature of chemical symbols which denote elements, not compounds or mixtures, and whilst niobium is a type of metal, the option 'Niobium is a metal' does not directly answer the question based on the symbol alone."
