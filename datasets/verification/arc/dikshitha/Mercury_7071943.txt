    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "sand",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, sand has the least capacity for holding water due to its coarse texture that allows water to pass through quickly. Unlike clay, which has very fine particles that can hold a significant amount of water, or humus which can greatly increase soil's water retention capacity, sand's physical properties inherently limit its ability to retain water."
