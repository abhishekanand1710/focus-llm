Question: When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the object will
Options: ['absorb the forces.', 'come to an immediate stop.', 'continue to move in the same direction.', 'move in the same direction as the larger force.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "move in the same direction as the larger force.",
    "reasoning": "When two unequal forces act in opposite directions on a moving object, the net force acting on the object is in the direction of the larger force. This net force will cause the object to continue moving in the direction of the larger force, albeit possibly at a changed velocity, depending on the magnitude of the forces. The concept of net force and its relationship with motion direction indicates that the object's future direction is determined by the direction of the net force, which in this scenario aligns with the larger of the two forces."
