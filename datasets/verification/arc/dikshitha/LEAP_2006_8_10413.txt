    }

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They are spread to others.",
    "reasoning": "The defining feature of communicable diseases, as indicated by their name and their characterizing relationship, is their ability to be transmitted from one person or organism to another, regardless of the season or the cure availability. While bacteria can be a cause and some diseases may have cures, the aspect of spreading to others is what classifies them as communicable."
