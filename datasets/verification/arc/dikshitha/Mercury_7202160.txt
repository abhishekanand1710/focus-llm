Key: Mercury_7202160

Question: New evidence suggests that "hot spots" may form in response to "twisting" stresses on plates. It is theorized that these stresses may eventually result in the splitting apart of the tectonic plate in the area of the hot spot. Which of the geographic features would be affected most by the splitting of a tectonic plate?
Options: ['the Himalayas', 'the Hawaiian Islands', 'the San Andreas Fault', 'the Mid-Atlantic Ridge']
Answer: the Hawaiian Islands

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the Mid-Atlantic Ridge",
    "reasoning": "Based on the given concepts and their relationships, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge would be most affected by the splitting of a tectonic plate because it is specifically a feature formed by the divergent boundary where tectonic plates are splitting apart. The concept of 'twisting stresses' acting on plates leading to the formation of 'hot spots' and eventual splitting aligns with the process of seafloor spreading observed at mid-ocean ridges like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Unlike the Himalayas, the Hawaiian Islands, and the San Andreas Fault, which are formed by different types of plate boundaries and geological activities, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge's very existence and continuation are directly related to the splitting and divergence of tectonic plates."
