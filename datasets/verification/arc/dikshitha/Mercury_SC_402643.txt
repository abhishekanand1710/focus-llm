Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the light comes on",
    "reasoning": "In a simple series circuit, closing the switch completes the circuit, allowing electricity to flow. This flow of electricity powers the light bulb, causing it to become illuminated. The concepts of 'Switch', 'Closed switch', and 'Electricity flow' along with their relationships to each other and to the 'Light bulb' explain how the action of closing the switch directly leads to the light bulb turning on."
