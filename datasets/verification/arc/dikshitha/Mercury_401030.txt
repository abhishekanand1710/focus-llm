Model Answer: {
    "answer": "compound",
    "reasoning": "The product of the reaction between calcium (Ca) and oxygen (O2), as given in the equation 2Ca + O2 -> 2CaO, is calcium oxide (CaO). Calcium oxide is a chemical compound that consists of calcium and oxygen chemically bonded together. Therefore, from the given options - metal, mixture, solution, and compound - the correct answer is 'compound' because it directly corresponds to the nature of the product formed in the reaction."
