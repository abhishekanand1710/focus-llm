Question: Which of these soil changes is due only to natural causes?
Options: ['Loss of minerals due to farming.', 'Deserts forming due to tree cutting.', 'Flooding due to dam construction.', 'Minerals washing out due to heavy rain.']
Answer: Minerals washing out due to heavy rain.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Minerals washing out due to heavy rain.",
    "reasoning": "Out of the given options, only 'Minerals washing out due to heavy rain' is a process that occurs purely due to natural causes, specifically heavy rainfall, without direct human intervention. The other options involve actions directly associated with human activities (farming, tree cutting, and dam construction) that alter the natural state of the environment."
