Question: Sea stars are consumers that live in a tide pool ecosystem that is alternately submerged and exposed by tides. This type of ecosystem contains poisonous anemones and many species of shellfish. The sea star's advantage in this ecosystem is that it can
Options: ['pry open shells.', 'produce a tiny light.', 'move quickly along the sea bottom.', 'survive the pressurized atmosphere of deep water.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "pry open shells.",
    "reasoning": "Sea stars in tide pool ecosystems, where they encounter shellfish as part of their natural habitat, possess the specialized ability to pry open the hard shells of these organisms to feed on them. This capability directly relates to their survival and predatory strategies within such ecosystems, setting apart 'pry open shells' as their distinct advantage among the options provided."
