Model Answer: {
    "answer": "1.496 x 10^8 km",
    "reasoning": "The average distance between Earth and the Sun is 149,600,000 kilometers. To convert this number into scientific notation, we need to express it as a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. The correct conversion moves the decimal point 8 places to the left, making the coefficient 1.496 and representing the large number as 10 raised to the power of 8. Therefore, the correct scientific notation for this distance is '1.496 x 10^8 km'. Other options either do not correctly adjust the decimal place or incorrectly use powers of 10."
