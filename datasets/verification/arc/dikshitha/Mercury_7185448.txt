Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They create new substances.",
    "reasoning": "Lighting a match and baking a cake are considered chemical changes because they both result in the creation of new substances. This transformation fits the definition of a chemical change, which is characterized by altering substances at the molecular level to produce one or more different substances. Contrary to merely changing the state of matter, altering volume, or creating energy, these processes fundamentally transform the chemical composition of the initial materials into something new."
