Question: Street maps are examples of two dimensional models. Which information cannot be determined using a basic map?
Options: ['distance from place to place', 'directions such as north and south', 'names of highways and roads', 'elevations such as distance above sea level']
Answer: elevations such as distance above sea level

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "elevations such as distance above sea level",
    "reasoning": "Based on the concepts and their relationships, street maps, as two-dimensional models, can depict distances, directions, and names of highways and roads efficiently. However, they are limited in representing three-dimensional data such as elevation above sea level. Since elevation requires a sense of depth or a third dimension that is not available on the two-dimensional surface of a basic street map, it cannot be determined directly from such maps."
