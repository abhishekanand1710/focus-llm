Model Answer: {
    "answer": "mica.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the information provided, the mineral must have a nonmetallic luster and be soft enough to be scratched with a fingernail. Among the options given, mica fits these criteria. Mica has a nonmetallic luster, is black or can appear in black varieties, and is soft enough to be scratched with a fingernail, unlike magnetite, hornblende, and quartz which are generally too hard to be scratched by a fingernail and in the case of magnetite, it also typically has a metallic luster."
