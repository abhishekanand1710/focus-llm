Model Answer: {
    "answer": "underground home",
    "reasoning": "An underground home provides the best protection for a forest animal against predators such as hawks and owls, which hunt primarily from the air. The other options like small size, sharp claws, and bright color, while offering some level of protection, do not as effectively remove the animal from the predator's domain as does an underground home."
