Question: Young robins build the same kinds of nests their parents build even if the young birds have never seen their parents build a nest. This is an example of
Options: ['a learned behavior.', 'an inherited behavior.', 'a physical characteristic.', 'acquired characteristic.']
Answer: an inherited behavior.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "an inherited behavior.",
    "reasoning": "Young robins are able to build nests similar to those of their parents even without observing them do so. This demonstrates that the knowledge or ability to construct these nests is not acquired through learning or imitation but is rather an inherent trait passed genetically from parents to offspring. Therefore, it is categorized as an inherited behavior."
