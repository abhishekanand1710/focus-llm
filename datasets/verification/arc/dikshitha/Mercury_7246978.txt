Model Answer: {
    "answer": "chemical energy to mechanical energy",
    "reasoning": "During shivering, the chemical energy stored in ATP is converted into mechanical energy by the process of muscle contraction. This mechanical energy is then used to generate movement or maintain posture, effectively responding to cold by attempting to generate warmth through rapid muscle activity."
