Model Answer: {
    "answer": "spreading disease.",
    "reasoning": "Health care professionals recommend the use of insect repellent for children to prevent insects, which can carry and spread diseases, from coming into contact with their skin or clothing. The primary purpose of insect repellent is not to stop insects from reproducing, laying eggs, or dying directly, but rather to prevent them from biting or attaching to humans, thereby reducing the risk of disease transmission."
