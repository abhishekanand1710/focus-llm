Model Answer: {
    "answer": "dehydration",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, 'dehydration' is the most likely cause of wilting in plants on a hot, sunny day. This is because excessive heat and sunlight can cause plants to lose more water through transpiration than they are able to absorb from the soil, leading to a loss of turgor pressure and resulting in wilting. The concepts of geotropism, photosynthesis, and blooming are not directly related to the immediate cause of wilting due to water loss."
