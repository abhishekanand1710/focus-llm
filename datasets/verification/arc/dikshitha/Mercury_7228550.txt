Model Answer: {
    "answer": "3",
    "reasoning": "The relationship between these concepts highlights that a codon, which is made up of three nucleotides, is required to specify a single amino acid in the process of protein synthesis. This is because the genetic code operates by reading the sequences of DNA or RNA three nucleotides at a time (as codons) to translate them into amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Therefore, it takes three basic units of information in a DNA molecule, in the form of a codon, to encode a single amino acid."
