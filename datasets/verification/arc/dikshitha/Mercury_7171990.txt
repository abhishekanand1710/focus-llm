Model Answer: {
    "answer": "moving body parts",
    "reasoning": "Muscle cells have the specific ability to store and release energy which is directly utilized in the contraction and movement of body parts. This biological process is essential for all forms of physical movement, distinguishing it from the other options which are primarily related to different systems and functions, such as the respiratory system for exchanging gases, the digestive system for absorbing nutrients, and the nervous system for sending nerve impulses."
