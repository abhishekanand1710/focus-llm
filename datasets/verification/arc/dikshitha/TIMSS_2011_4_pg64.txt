Model Answer: {
    "answer": "salt water",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, 'salt water' is identified as a mixture because it is created by combining salt and water, making it a substance composed of more than one type of molecule mixed together. The other options, 'sugar', 'water vapor', and 'salt', are considered pure substances rather than mixtures because they consist of only one type of molecule."
