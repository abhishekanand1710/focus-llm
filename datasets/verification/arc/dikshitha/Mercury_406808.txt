Question: The Ohio state tree is the buckeye. Which of these is a trait that is inherited by the buckeye tree in the reproduction process?
Options: ['number of leaves that fall during winter', 'change in leaf color during the autumn season', 'type of mineral that is absorbed from the soil', 'amount of water that is available for growth']
Answer: change in leaf color during the autumn season

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Change in Leaf Color During the Autumn Season",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, change in leaf color during the autumn season is most clearly an inherited trait. Traits like the number of leaves that fall during winter could also be influenced by genetics, but the change in leaf color is well-documented as being directly tied to genetic factors in plants, affecting how they respond to changes in daylight and temperature. The other options listed pertain more to environmental factors that are external to the genetics of the tree itself."
