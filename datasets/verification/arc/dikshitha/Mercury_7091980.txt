    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "crust.",
    "reasoning": "The question specifically mentions a solid layer of Earth that moves over a viscous layer. Based on the relationships identified, the crust is the outermost solid layer of Earth that moves over the asthenosphere, which is a viscous, mechanically weak region of the upper mantle. Therefore, the correct answer is 'crust.'"
