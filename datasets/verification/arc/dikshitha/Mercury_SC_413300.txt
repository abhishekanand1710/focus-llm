Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It will freeze.",
    "reasoning": "Given the temperature of water changes from 5\u00b0C to -1\u00b0C, it crosses the freezing point of water (0\u00b0C). As the temperature drops below 0\u00b0C, water transitions from its liquid state to a solid state, indicating it freezes. This is in line with the concepts of temperature, water, and the freezing point of water, along with their interconnected relationships."
