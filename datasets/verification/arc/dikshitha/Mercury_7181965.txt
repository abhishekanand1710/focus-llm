Question: Fossils of the fern Glossopteris have been found in the continents of South America, Africa, Asia, and Antarctica. The seeds of this fern were too small to be dispersed by wind. Which is best indicated by the presence of Glossopteris fossils on these continents?
Options: ['Glossopteris was versatile enough to adapt to all climates.', 'The landmasses were joined together in pre-historic times.', 'Fossils were much better preserved in the southern continents.', 'The northern climate regions were not suitable for plant growth.']
Answer: The landmasses were joined together in pre-historic times.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The landmasses were joined together in pre-historic times.",
    "reasoning": "The presence of Glossopteris fossils across multiple now-separated continents supports the theory of continental drift and the existence of a supercontinent, likely Pangaea, during the Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras. This historical land connectivity, rather than the plant's ability to adapt to diverse climates or the peculiar preservation of fossils in certain regions, explains the widespread distribution of Glossopteris fossils. The concept of seed dispersal not being wind-based also aligns with the idea that the continents once connected allowed for easier spread of such species without the need for wind dispersal mechanisms."
