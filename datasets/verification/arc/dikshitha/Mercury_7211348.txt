Question: A student wants to use a stream table to test the influence of water acidity on the erosion rate of a stream. Which variable should be constant in this experiment?
Options: ['angle of tilt of the table', 'acidity of the water', 'amount of sediment eroded', 'rate that sediment is eroded']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "angle of tilt of the table",
    "reasoning": "In this experiment, the focus is on how the acidity of water influences the rate of erosion. To accurately measure this, all other potential variables that could affect the erosion rate must be held constant. Therefore, the angle of tilt of the table should remain constant because changes to the tilt would alter water flow speed and, consequently, the rate of erosion, making it difficult to isolate the effect of water acidity."
