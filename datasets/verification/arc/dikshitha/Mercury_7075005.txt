]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "statement of opinion.",
    "reasoning": "The claim that red blood cells are more important than white blood cells cannot be universally proven as fact because the importance of cells depends on the context (oxygen transport versus fighting infections). It does not align with the definition of a scientific conclusion or hypothesis, as it is based on a subjective assessment and not on a hypothesis or conclusion derived from systematic research. Therefore, it is best categorized as a statement of opinion."
