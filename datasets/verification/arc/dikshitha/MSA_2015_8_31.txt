Question: Students study human body structure to learn how the body functions. Which life-size model would best represent the size, shape, and location of human internal organs?
Options: ['a two-dimensional upper body diagram with magnetic stickers of the organs', 'a three-dimensional plastic upper body with removable parts', 'a two-dimensional detailed wall poster', 'a three-dimensional paper body']
Answer: a three-dimensional plastic upper body with removable parts

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a three-dimensional plastic upper body with removable parts",
    "reasoning": "This option best represents the size, shape, and location of human internal organs as it provides a realistic three-dimensional view that allows for interactive learning through removable parts. This hands-on approach enhances understanding of human body structure, surpassing the educational value provided by two-dimensional diagrams or posters, and is more durable and detailed compared to models made of paper."
