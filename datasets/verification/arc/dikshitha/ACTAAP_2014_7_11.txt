Question: A teacher puts a cup of coffee into the cup holder of a car. When the car stops suddenly some of the coffee spills out of the cup. Which statement best explains why the coffee spills?
Options: ['The coffee stays in motion because the stopping force acts only on the car.', 'The coffee stays in motion because a force from the cup holder pulls on the coffee.', 'The stopping force on the car causes an equal and opposite reaction from the coffee.', 'The stopping force causes the motion of the car to slow down and the motion of the coffee to speed up.']
Answer: The coffee stays in motion because the stopping force acts only on the car.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The coffee stays in motion because the stopping force acts only on the car.",
    "reasoning": "According to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. When the car stops suddenly due to a stopping force applied to it, the coffee inside, due to its inertia, continues to move in its original direction of motion. This is because the stopping force acts directly on the car, not on the coffee inside it, leading to the spilling of the coffee."
