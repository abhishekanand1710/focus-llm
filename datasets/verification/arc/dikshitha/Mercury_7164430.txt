Key: Mercury_7164430

Question: Mercury and gold are both metals. Unlike gold, mercury cannot be used to make jewelry because it is a liquid at room temperature. The difference in the state of matter is an example of which type of property?
Options: ['chemical', 'electrical', 'nuclear', 'physical']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "physical",
    "reasoning": "The difference in states of matter between mercury and gold, which is the basis for why one cannot be used to make jewelry, is directly related to their physical properties. Mercury's liquid state at room temperature compared to gold's solid state is a matter of physical condition, not chemical, electrical, or nuclear properties."
