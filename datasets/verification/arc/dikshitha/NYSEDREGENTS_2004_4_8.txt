Question: Base your answers on the information below. One hot, summer day it rained very heavily. After the rain, a plastic pan on a picnic table had 2 cm of rainwater in it. Four hours later, all the rainwater in the pan was gone. If the day were cool instead of hot, the rainwater in the pan would have disappeared
Options: ['slower', 'faster', 'in the same amount of time']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "slower",
    "reasoning": "Given that higher temperatures increase the rate of evaporation (as reflected in the relationship between Temperature and Evaporation), and knowing that on a hot day the rainwater in the pan vanished in four hours, it logically follows that if the day were cooler, the process of evaporation would occur more slowly. Therefore, the rainwater in the pan would have disappeared slower if the day were cool instead of hot."
