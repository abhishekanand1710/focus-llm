Question: Why is competition among males during mating season important in some animal species?
Options: ['It ensures that genes from the fittest animals are passed on.', 'It allows females to distinguish between adult and juvenile males.', 'It provides the species with new ways of communication.', 'It speeds the process of reproduction.']
Answer: It ensures that genes from the fittest animals are passed on.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It ensures that genes from the fittest animals are passed on.",
    "reasoning": "The competition among males during mating season is crucial for ensuring that only the fittest males, who are most adapted to their environment and have a higher chance of survival, are able to mate. This ensures that the offspring inherit the best possible genes for survival and reproduction, contributing to the overall fitness and success of the species. This relationship is supported by the concepts of competition among males leading to the fittest animals mating and passing their superior genes on to the next generation, which is essential for the continued survival and evolution of the species."
