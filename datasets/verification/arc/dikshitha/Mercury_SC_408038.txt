Question: In December, one side of Earth will receive less energy from the Sun than the other side. Which statement best explains this fact?
Options: ['Earth rotates on its axis.', 'Earth is tilted on its axis.', 'Sunlight traveling to Earth reflects off the Moon.', 'Sunlight traveling to Earth is blocked by Moon.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Earth is tilted on its axis.",
    "reasoning": "The unequal distribution of sunlight on Earth in December, leading to one side receiving less energy from the Sun than the other, is best explained by Earth's axial tilt. This tilt causes the Northern Hemisphere to lean away from the Sun during this time, receiving less direct sunlight and thus less energy compared to the Southern Hemisphere."
