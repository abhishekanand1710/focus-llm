Question: Which characteristic do single-celled organisms and multicellular organisms have in common?
Options: ['Both have cells with specialized functions for each life process.', 'Both perform all life processes within one cell.', 'Both have a way to get rid of waste materials.', 'Both are able to make food from sunlight.']
Answer: Both have a way to get rid of waste materials.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Both have a way to get rid of waste materials.",
    "reasoning": "Both single-celled and multicellular organisms generate waste products from their cellular activities and have mechanisms to eliminate these waste products from their system. This is necessary to avoid toxicity from accumulating byproducts of metabolism. The other options either apply specifically to only one type (i.e., 'Both have cells with specialized functions for each life process' is more applicable to multicellular organisms, and 'Both perform all life processes within one cell' applies only to single-celled organisms) or are not true for all organisms (i.e., 'Both are able to make food from sunlight' does not apply to organisms that do not perform photosynthesis, such as many types of animals and fungi)."
