Question: Most volcanoes develop due to interactions between two tectonic plates. Which of the tectonic plate interactions is least likely to produce volcanic activity?
Options: ['two diverging oceanic plates', 'two converging oceanic plates', 'two diverging continental plates', 'two converging continental plates']
Answer: two converging continental plates

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "two converging continental plates",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, 'two converging continental plates' is the least likely to produce volcanic activity. This is because when two continental plates converge, they primarily cause the upliftment of land resulting in mountain building, rather than subduction which is required for volcanic activity. The other options involve either subduction (which directly leads to volcanism) or rifting (which can also facilitate volcanic activity by allowing magma to reach the surface)."
