Model Answer: {
    "answer": "7",
    "reasoning": "Given the relationship that a larger sample size increases the reliability of an experiment's outcomes, and considering the options provided, selecting 7 eggs would allow Oscar to achieve the most reliable results in his investigation on how many days it takes for a chick to hatch from an egg. This option ensures that variations and anomalies can be better averaged out, providing a more consistent and reliable result."
