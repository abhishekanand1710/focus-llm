Question: Which statement best describes the relationship between the total amount of water vapor the atmosphere can hold and the temperature of the atmosphere?
Options: ['The amount of water vapor is not related to atmospheric temperature.', 'The amount of water vapor increases as the atmospheric temperature increases.', 'The amount of water vapor increases as the atmospheric temperature decreases.', 'The amount of water vapor decreases as the atmospheric temperature increases.']
Answer: The amount of water vapor increases as the atmospheric temperature increases.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The amount of water vapor increases as the atmospheric temperature increases.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the relationships identified, as the atmospheric temperature increases, so does the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water vapor. This is because a warmth in the atmosphere enables the air to hold more water vapor, directly linking atmospheric temperature with the capacity of air to contain water vapor. The increase in temperature reduces air density, which in turn allows for more water vapor to be present in the atmosphere."
