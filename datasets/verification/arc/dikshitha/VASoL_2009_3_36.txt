Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Amount of yearly rainfall",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, the amount of yearly rainfall has the most significant and direct influence on the condition and development of a grassy field over time. Adequate rainfall is essential for the growth of grass and the overall sustainability of the ecosystem, leading to a more profound and lasting change in the grassy field's composition and health compared to other factors listed."
