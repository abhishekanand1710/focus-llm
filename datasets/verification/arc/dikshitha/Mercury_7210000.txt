Question: Students make weather observations outside the school building, and then they record their observations. Which observation should be recorded as a fact?
Options: ['The air feels very cold.', 'The wind is blowing at 5 m/s.', 'It is nicer than the day before.', 'It looks like it might warm up later.']
Answer: The wind is blowing at 5 m/s.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The wind is blowing at 5 m/s.",
    "reasoning": "The observation that the wind is blowing at 5 m/s is a quantifiable and measurable fact. Unlike the subjective or predictive nature of the other options, measuring wind speed provides a specific, verifiable piece of data that can be accurately recorded and proven true or false."
}
