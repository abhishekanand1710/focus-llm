Model Answer: {
    "answer": "insulators.",
    "reasoning": "Potholders are designed to protect the user's hands from the heat of hot pans removed from an oven. This protection is achieved because potholders function as insulators, preventing heat from passing through them to the user's hands. Unlike conductors, which allow heat to pass through, or transmitters, which would disseminate heat or signals, insulators block the flow of heat, making 'insulators.' the correct answer."
