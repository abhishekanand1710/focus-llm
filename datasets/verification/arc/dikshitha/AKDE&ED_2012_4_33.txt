Question: A student gives a red toy car a push on a wooden floor. The student then pushes the same red toy car on a cement floor. Which question is the student most likely investigating?
Options: ['How fast does a toy car usually roll?', 'What is the best way to make a toy car roll?', 'Which surface allows a toy car to roll farther?', 'Does color have an effect on the distance a toy car rolls?']
Answer: Which surface allows a toy car to roll farther?

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Which surface allows a toy car to roll farther?",
    "reasoning": "The student is comparing the effects of different surfaces (wooden and cement floor) on the distance a toy car rolls after being pushed, indicating an investigation into how surface material affects the rolling distance of the toy car due to differences in friction. The other options are not directly related to the change of surfaces."
