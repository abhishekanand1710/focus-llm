    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "N and P",
    "reasoning": "Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) have the most similar properties among the given options because they are both found in the same group in the Periodic Table. This means they have similar chemical behaviors due to having the same valence electron configuration. Elements in the same group tend to show greater similarity in chemical properties compared to elements that belong to different groups or periods. Other pairs listed do not share this level of similarity; for instance, Li and B are adjacent but belong to different groups, I and Ca are from entirely different groups with distinct properties, and K is an alkaline metal while He is a noble gas, making their properties markedly different."
