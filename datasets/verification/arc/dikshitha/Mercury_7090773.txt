Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the ability of Earth to maintain lower temperatures",
    "reasoning": "The increase in carbon dioxide levels, primarily due to automobiles and industrialization, contributes directly to global warming, which in turn reduces the ability of Earth to maintain lower temperatures. This is because higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere trap more heat, leading to an increase in Earth's average temperature."
