Question: When a compression wave travels through a medium, in what direction is the medium displaced?
Options: ['upward', 'downward', 'in the same direction', 'in the opposite direction']
Answer: in the same direction

        "description": "In a compression wave, the displacement of medium's particles is in the same direction as the wave propagation."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "in the same direction",
    "reasoning": "Compression waves cause the medium's particles to move in a way that their displacement is parallel to, or in the same direction as, the direction of the wave's propagation."
}
