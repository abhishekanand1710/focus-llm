Question: Which is a hypothesis that can be easily tested?
Options: ['The Moon causes high tides.', 'During which season are the tides the highest?', 'What is the phase of the Moon when tides are highest?', 'When the Moon is full, the tides will be at their highest.']
Answer: When the Moon is full, the tides will be at their highest.

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "When the Moon is full, the tides will be at their highest.",
    "reasoning": "This hypothesis can be easily tested by comparing tide levels to the phases of the Moon. The concept of the Moon affecting the tides is well established, with the Full Moon phase specifically known to correlate with higher tide levels due to the gravitational pull. This makes the hypothesis directly testable with empirical data on tides and lunar phases."
