    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a pie chart",
    "reasoning": "A pie chart is the most appropriate format to display the percentage of energy obtained from several food sources for a population of eagles because it efficiently visualizes the contributions of different parts to a whole. In this context, it effectively represents the proportion of energy each food source contributes to the eagles, making it easy to understand at a glance."
