    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "digested into simpler substances",
    "reasoning": "Immediately after an animal eats food, the food undergoes the digestion process, where it is broken down into simpler substances that can be absorbed and utilized by the body. This is supported by the relationships identified among the concepts of animals consuming food, which then undergoes digestion to produce simpler substances."
