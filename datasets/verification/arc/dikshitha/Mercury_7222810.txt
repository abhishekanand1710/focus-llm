Question: In the 17th century, Galileo proposed a hypothesis to explain how suction pumps work. Galileo's hypothesis was disproved, but later it helped Torricelli in the development of an instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure. How did Galileo's hypothesis most likely help with the development of this new technology?
Options: ['by leading Galileo to design a different technology', "by allowing another scientist to critique Galileo's hypothesis", 'by providing evidence of the effects of atmospheric pressure', 'by inspiring another scientist to test an alternative hypothesis']
Answer: by inspiring another scientist to test an alternative hypothesis

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "by providing evidence of the effects of atmospheric pressure",
    "reasoning": "Galileo's hypothesis, although disproved, helped to highlight the effects of atmospheric pressure, thus indirectly contributing to Torricelli's development of the barometer. This is because understanding the role of atmospheric pressure was a critical step in measuring it accurately, leading Torricelli to invent an instrument capable of such measurements."
