Model Answer: {
    "answer": "plugging many appliances into one outlet",
    "reasoning": "Among the options listed, 'plugging many appliances into one outlet' is the exception as it compromises safety. It leads to overloading the electrical system, which can cause overheating and potentially start a fire. The other options contribute to safety by either preventing electrical accidents, avoiding hazards such as short circuits or fires, or minimizing the risk of electrocution by keeping water and electricity separate."
