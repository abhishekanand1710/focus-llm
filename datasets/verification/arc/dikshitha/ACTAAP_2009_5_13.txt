Question: Alan is using cabbage juice to determine the relative pH of various household solutions. Which of these steps communicates the results of his investigation?
Options: ['Conduct multiple trials', 'Write down a procedure', 'Identify the materials to be tested', 'Record observations and data in a journal']
Answer: Record observations and data in a journal

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Record observations and data in a journal",
    "reasoning": "Recording observations and data in a journal is the step that directly communicates the results of Alan's investigation into the pH levels of various household solutions using cabbage juice. This step follows conducting the tests and allows for analysis, comparison, and communication of the finding. It is an essential part of scientific method to document and share results."
