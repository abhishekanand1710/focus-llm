Question: A researcher is conducting an investigation to determine if water temperature affects the growth rate of a certain type of fish in a lake. Which unit would the researcher use when determining the mass of the fish?
Options: ['centimeters', 'kilometers', 'grams', 'liters']
Answer: grams

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "grams",
    "reasoning": "Among the listed options, 'grams' is the appropriate unit for measuring the mass of the fish. This is based on the concept that 'Mass is measured in grams,' particularly in scientific studies where the physical mass of objects, such as fish in this investigation, is a significant variable. The researcher aims to determine the effect of water temperature on growth rate, which is indicated by changes in the fish's mass, properly quantified in grams."
