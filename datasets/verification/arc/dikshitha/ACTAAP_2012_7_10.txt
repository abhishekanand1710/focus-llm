Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Albumen",
    "reasoning": "The question asks for the clear, thick fluid inside a poultry egg that serves as protection for the embryo. Among the options, 'Albumen' is the only one that fits this description, as it is known as egg white, surrounding the embryo and yolk, providing protection and hydration to the embryo."
