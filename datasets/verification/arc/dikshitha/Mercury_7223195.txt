Question: Which statement best describes a liquid sample?
Options: ['It will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container.', 'It keeps its shape when transferred to a larger container.', 'Its volume can be greatly reduced by adding pressure.', 'Its shape can be changed by increasing its temperature.']
Answer: It will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container.",
    "reasoning": "The defining characteristic of a liquid is that it retains its volume regardless of the container it is in but takes the shape of that container. This implies that while liquids can change shape, their volume remains constant when transferred from one container to another, making the statement 'It will retain its volume if transferred to a larger container.' the best description of a liquid sample."
