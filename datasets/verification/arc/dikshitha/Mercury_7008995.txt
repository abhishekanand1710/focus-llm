Model Answer: {
    "answer": "time delay of the reflected waves.",
    "reasoning": "The core function of sonar equipment is to detect and locate objects under water by sending out sound waves and measuring the time delay of the reflected waves. This time delay, between sending the wave and receiving its reflection, is crucial for determining the distance to and location of underwater objects. The concepts and relationships identified highlight this function, showing that the sonar technology fundamentally relies on the principle of detecting the time delay of reflected waves to operate effectively."
