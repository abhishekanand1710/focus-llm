    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "oil",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, 'oil' is the only one classified as a nonrenewable resource. Oil forms over millions of years from the remains of ancient organisms, and the rate at which we consume oil far outpaces its natural replenishment rate. Unlike soil, food, and water, which can be considered renewable under certain conditions because they can be replenished naturally with the passage of time, oil's regeneration process is significantly slower than its consumption rate, rendering it nonrenewable."
