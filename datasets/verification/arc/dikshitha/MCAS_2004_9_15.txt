Model Answer: {
    "answer": "8 ohms",
    "reasoning": "Using Ohm's Law, Resistance (R) can be calculated using Voltage (V) and Electric Current (I), where R = V / I. Given the Voltage of 24 V and Electric Current of 3 A, the Resistance can be calculated as 24 V / 3 A = 8 ohms. This matches with the option '8 ohms'."
