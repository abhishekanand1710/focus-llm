Question: A student has a pink eraser on her desk. Which property shows that the eraser is a solid?
Options: ['Its color stays the same when it is broken in half.', 'Its temperature goes up when it is rubbed on paper.', 'Its shape is definite when it is placed in a new spot.', 'Its size changes when it is used to remove pencil marks.']
Answer: Its shape is definite when it is placed in a new spot.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "'Its shape is definite when it is placed in a new spot.'",
    "reasoning": "The property that indicates the eraser is a solid is 'Its shape is definite when it is placed in a new spot.' This is because solids maintain a definite shape regardless of where they are placed, which directly relates to the characteristic property of solids having a fixed volume and shape. Color change upon breaking, temperature change from friction, and size reduction from use do not specifically indicate that an object is a solid, as those properties can be observed in objects in various states of matter under certain conditions."
