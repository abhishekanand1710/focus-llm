    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "an increase in the motion of the copper particles",
    "reasoning": "The increase in temperature of a copper wire is primarily associated with an increase in the motion or kinetic activity of the copper particles. This heightened motion reflects the added thermal energy within the wire, indicating that temperature rise is directly related to the microscopic motion of constituent particles, as opposed to changes in their size, mass, or spacing."
