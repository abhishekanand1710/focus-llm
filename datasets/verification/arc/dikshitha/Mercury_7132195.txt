Model Answer: {
    "answer": "pulley",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, the pulley is a simple machine that specifically increases the distance over which a load travels and reduces the needed force to lift or move that load. It uses a wheel and a rope or belt to change the direction of the applied force, making it easier to lift heavy objects."
