Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They have the same intensity of sunlight.",
    "reasoning": "Places at the same latitude are positioned similarly relative to the sun, which results in them receiving a similar intensity of sunlight throughout the year. This is a direct consequence of the Earth's spherical shape and its tilt on its axis, leading to consistent solar exposure patterns at given latitudes. This reasoning is supported by the relationship identified between latitude and the intensity of sunlight, where areas at similar latitudes are primarily influenced in this aspect. In contrast, wind patterns, rainfall, and the kinds of severe weather can vary greatly due to local geographic features, ocean currents, and other atmospheric conditions that are not solely determined by latitude."
