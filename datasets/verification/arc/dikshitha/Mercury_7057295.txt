Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the energy from the sidewalk flows to the ice.",
    "reasoning": "The process of melting ice on a hot sidewalk involves the transfer of thermal energy. This transfer occurs from the warmer object (the sidewalk, which has absorbed heat from the environment) to the cooler object (the block of ice). The mechanism for this energy transfer is primarily through conduction, where heat moves from the hot sidewalk to the ice, causing the ice to melt. Thus, the correct option is that the energy from the sidewalk flows to the ice."
