Key: MCAS_2002_8_9

Question: A scientist on a field trip discovered a new organism. She examined its cells under a microscope and observed several different structures, including a nucleus, a cell wall, and some chloroplasts. This organism would correctly be classified in which of the following kingdoms?
Options: ['Animalia', 'Monera', 'Plantae', 'Fungi']
Answer: Plantae

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Plantae",
    "reasoning": "The organism described must belong to the Plantae kingdom because its cells contain a nucleus, indicating it is eukaryotic; have cell walls, a feature shared with fungi and plants; and possess chloroplasts, a distinctive feature of photosynthetic organisms like plants. The presence of chloroplasts, in particular, differentiates it from fungi, and its eukaryotic nature excludes it from Monera, while Animalia members lack both cell walls and chloroplasts."
