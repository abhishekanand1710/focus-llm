Question: Most mountains on Earth occur in huge ranges stretching for thousands of miles. Which event is most likely to cause the formation of these mountain ranges?
Options: ['erosion of rocks', 'violent earthquakes', 'volcanic eruption', 'movement of plates']
Answer: movement of plates

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "movement of plates",
    "reasoning": "The formation of mountain ranges is primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates. This process can create mountains through mechanisms such as the collision of continental plates (leading to the folding and thrusting up of rock layers) and the subduction of oceanic plates beneath continental plates, causing uplift. Other options like erosion, volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes can affect mountains but do not primarily cause the extensive mountain ranges seen on Earth."
