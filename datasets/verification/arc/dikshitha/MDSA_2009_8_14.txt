Model Answer: {
    "answer": "an electric stove",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, an electric stove is designed specifically to transform electrical energy into useful heat energy for the purpose of cooking. The concept and relationships highlight that while other devices listed also use electricity, they do not primarily convert it into heat energy for a utilitarian purpose in the way an electric stove does."
