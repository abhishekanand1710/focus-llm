    },
    {
        "name": "Natural Gas",
        "description": "A gaseous fossil fuel consisting primarily of methane and used for heating and as a fuel source."

        "related_concept": "Fossil Fuel",
        "description": "Wood is derived from living trees and not from fossilized remains, making it a renewable resource rather than a fossil fuel."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Wood",
    "reasoning": "Wood is not a fossil fuel because unlike coal, oil, and natural gas, it is not formed from the fossilized remains of ancient organisms. Wood comes from living trees and plants and is considered a renewable resource, whereas fossil fuels are non-renewable and originate from the buried remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago."
