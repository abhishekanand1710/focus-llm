Question: Decomposers are important to the flow of energy in an ecosystem because they
Options: ['are at the top of every food chain.', 'eat things other organisms do not eat.', 'make up a large portion of the top layer of the soil.', 'break organic material into parts that can be reused.']
Answer: break organic material into parts that can be reused.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "break organic material into parts that can be reused.",
    "reasoning": "Decomposers play a crucial role in ecosystems by breaking down dead or decaying organic material. This process facilitates the flow of energy in an ecosystem by converting the material into simpler forms that can be reused by other organisms, thus maintaining the cycle of nutrients and energy."
