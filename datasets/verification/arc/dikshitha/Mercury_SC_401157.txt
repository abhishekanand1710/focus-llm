Model Answer: {
    "answer": "is a good electrical insulator.",
    "reasoning": "The purpose of wrapping a conducting wire in plastic is to insulate the wire electrically, preventing the user from coming into electrical contact with the wire. Plastic is chosen for this purpose because it is a good electrical insulator, thereby providing safety by preventing the flow of electricity to or from unintended paths."
