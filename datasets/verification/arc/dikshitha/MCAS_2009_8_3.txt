Question: Which of the following statements best explains why it is warmer at the equator than at the North Pole?
Options: ['The equator has a larger area than the North Pole.', 'The equator is closer to the Sun than the North Pole.', 'The equator receives more direct sunlight than the North Pole.', 'The equator has more hours of daylight per year than the North Pole.']
Answer: The equator receives more direct sunlight than the North Pole.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The equator receives more direct sunlight than the North Pole.",
    "reasoning": "The primary reason for it being warmer at the Equator than at the North Pole is the angle at which sunlight hits the Earth. At the Equator, sunlight strikes the surface more directly than at the North Pole. This results in higher energy absorption and warmer temperatures. The concepts of area, proximity to the Sun in terms of distance, and hours of daylight per year, do not fundamentally explain temperature differences as succinctly as the concept of direct sunlight does. Area does not directly affect temperature, proximity to the Sun is almost uniform considering the vast distances involved, and while hours of daylight can influence temperature patterns, it is the directness and intensity of sunlight that is most critical."
