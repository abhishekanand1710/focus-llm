Question: Which of the following distinguishes the organisms in the kingdom Fungi from other eukaryotic organisms?
Options: ['Fungi are unicellular.', 'Fungi reproduce sexually.', 'Fungi obtain nutrients by absorption.', 'Fungi make food through photosynthesis.']
Answer: Fungi obtain nutrients by absorption.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Fungi obtain nutrients by absorption.",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, the characteristic that distinctively defines the organisms in Kingdom Fungi from other eukaryotic organisms is their method of obtaining nutrients. Fungi absorb nutrients from their environment, whereas the other options describe characteristics that are not unique to fungi or do not apply to them. For instance, fungi are not all unicellular, they do reproduce sexually but so do many other eukaryotes, and they do not make food through photosynthesis."
