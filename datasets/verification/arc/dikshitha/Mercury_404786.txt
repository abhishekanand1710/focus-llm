    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "O_{2}",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, 'O_{2}' is the only one that represents a molecule formed by two atoms of the same element (Oxygen), making it the closest to an element. 'KBr', '2KCl', and 'FeO_{2}' are all compounds consisting of two or more different elements chemically combined, thus not fitting the definition of a single element."
