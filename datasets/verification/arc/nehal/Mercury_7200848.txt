Question: A plant that grows red flowers was crossed with the same kind of plant that grows white flowers. Their offspring grew pink flowers. Which best explains why the offspring grew pink flowers?
Options: ['The offspring experienced a genetic mutation.', 'The offspring resulted from asexual reproduction.', 'The genes for flower color exhibited incomplete dominance.', 'A gene for pink-colored flowers was recessive in one of the parents.']
Answer: The genes for flower color exhibited incomplete dominance.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The genes for flower color exhibited incomplete dominance.",
    "reasoning": "The best explanation for offspring producing pink flowers when a plant with red flowers is crossed with one with white flowers is the principle of incomplete dominance. This genetic mechanism allows for a blending of traits, where neither parent's gene is completely dominant over the other, resulting in an intermediate phenotype, such as pink flowers, rather than a mix of red and white flowers or the dominance of one color over the other."
