Key: MCAS_1998_8_8

Question: Many common hand tools create a mechanical advantage by using the basic principles found in simple machines. For example, a screwdriver uses the principles of the wheel and axle. In order to increase gripping force, pliers use the principle demonstrated in the

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "lever.",
    "reasoning": "To increase gripping force, pliers use a principle that requires applying force to one point to generate a greater force at another point, which is the basic principle of the lever. This is because pliers have pivot points and arms that act like levers, amplifying the force applied by our hands to the handles to achieve a more significant gripping or cutting force. None of the other options (pulley, wedge, screw) directly describe the operation mechanism of pliers."
