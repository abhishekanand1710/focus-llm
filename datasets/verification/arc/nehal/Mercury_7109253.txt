Question: Scientists have measured the rate of growth of the Atlantic Ocean basin to be about 2 to 3 cm per year. This type of activity coincides with the formation of ridges on the ocean floor. What is the most likely cause of this activity?
Options: ['erosion from tidal action', 'the deposition of sediment', 'the flow of continental basalt', 'movement from tectonic plates']
Answer: movement from tectonic plates

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "movement from tectonic plates",
    "reasoning": "The expansion of the Atlantic Ocean basin and the formation of ridges on the ocean floor are directly attributed to the movement of tectonic plates. This tectonic activity causes the ocean basin to grow at a rate of about 2 to 3 cm per year by creating new crust, thus demonstrating that the most likely cause of this activity is the movement from tectonic plates."
