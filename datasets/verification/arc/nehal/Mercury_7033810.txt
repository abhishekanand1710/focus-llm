Key: Mercury_7033810

Question: How has burning fossil fuels most caused a decline to the quality of air that people breathe?
Options: ['by adding particle pollution', 'by creating a hole in the ozone layer', 'by causing acid precipitation to fall', 'by increasing the levels of carbon dioxide']
Answer: by adding particle pollution

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "by adding particle pollution",
    "reasoning": "Burning fossil fuels is a major source of particle pollution. This process releases a variety of pollutants, including fine particles (particulate matter), into the air, which directly diminishes the quality of the air we breathe. It introduces harmful particles into the atmosphere, causing health issues and reducing air quality more directly than the other options presented."
