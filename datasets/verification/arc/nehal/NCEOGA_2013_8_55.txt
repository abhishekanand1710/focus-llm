Question: In a food pyramid, which best explains why the number of organisms decreases from one trophic level to the next?
Options: ['Consumers at the lower level require more energy than the top-level consumers.', 'Consumers at the top level require more energy than the lower-level consumers.', 'The consumers are feeding on larger organisms that have less energy.', 'The consumers are feeding on smaller organisms that have less energy.']
Answer: Consumers at the top level require more energy than the lower-level consumers.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Consumers at the top level require more energy than the lower-level consumers.",
    "reasoning": "As energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next, a significant amount of energy is lost primarily due to the second law of thermodynamics which states that energy conversions are not 100% efficient. At each step, only about 10% of the energy is transferred to the next level, while the rest is lost as heat. This leads to fewer organisms being supported at higher trophic levels since more energy is required by top-level consumers to sustain themselves. Thus, the correct answer is that consumers at the top level require more energy than those at lower levels, explaining the decrease in the number of organisms from one trophic level to the next."
