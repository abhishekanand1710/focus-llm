Model Answer: {
    "answer": "bubbles when acid is placed on it",
    "reasoning": "The option 'bubbles when acid is placed on it' directly refers to a 'chemical property' of a mineral, specifically an acid reaction, which is a characteristic behavior when it reacts with chemicals (in this case, acid). This is a clear indication of a chemical interaction between the acid and the mineral, distinguishing it from the other options which describe physical properties such as hardness (being easily scratched), cleavage (breaking easily), and luster (reflecting light)."
