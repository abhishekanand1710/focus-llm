Model Answer: {
    "answer": "mechanical weathering",
    "reasoning": "The question asks about the formation of the surface of a beach, which is primarily made up of sand and small pebbles. These materials most often originate from the physical breakdown of rocks into smaller pieces without changing their chemical composition, a process known as mechanical weathering. This process, more than chemical weathering, mass movement, or volcanic eruption, directly leads to the creation of the sand and pebbles that typically constitute the surface of a beach."
