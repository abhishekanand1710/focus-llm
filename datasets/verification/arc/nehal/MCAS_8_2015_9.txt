Model Answer: {
    "answer": "to make it easier to transport the computer",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, the most relevant reason for imposing a weight restriction on a laptop computer is to enhance its transportability. Laptops are valued for their portability, and a lighter device significantly contributes to this characteristic, making it easier for users to carry it around. Unlike the other options, which either involve costs (manufacturing costs, the cost of building the prototype) or testing ease, which are less directly impacted by the weight of the laptop, transportability is a core feature that directly benefits from a lower weight, aligning with the primary appeal of laptops as portable devices."
