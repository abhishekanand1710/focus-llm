Question: A tropical rain forest contains many tall trees. Smaller plants with large leaves grow at the base of the tall trees. The large leaves are most likely an adaptation of the plant due to which condition?
Options: ['lack of sunlight', 'lack of oxygen', 'lack of water', 'lack of food']
Answer: lack of sunlight

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "lack of sunlight",
    "reasoning": "Smaller plants with large leaves at the base of the tall trees in a tropical rain forest primarily adapt to the condition of lack of sunlight. The taller trees create a canopy that shades the forest floor, resulting in reduced sunlight reaching the smaller plants. To maximize the capture of limited sunlight, these plants have evolved large leaves. This adaptation is not directly related to lack of oxygen, water, or food, as tropical rain forests are rich in these resources."
