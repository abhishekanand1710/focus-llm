Question: Which statement is the best description of what happens in the rock cycle?
Options: ['Rocks on old mountains are gradually weathered away while mountain building and volcanism form new mountains.', 'Once formed, rocks stay in place until rocks above them are weathered away, and they reach the surface.', 'As sedimentary rocks are buried deep below other rocks, they are changed by heat and pressure, eventually return to the surface, and are weathered again.', 'Younger sedimentary rocks are always deposited on top of older metamorphic or igneous rocks.']
Answer: As sedimentary rocks are buried deep below other rocks, they are changed by heat and pressure, eventually return to the surface, and are weathered again.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "As sedimentary rocks are buried deep below other rocks, they are changed by heat and pressure, eventually return to the surface, and are weathered again.",
    "reasoning": "This option accurately describes a crucial and continuous part of the rock cycle involving the transformation of sedimentary rocks into metamorphic rocks due to heat and pressure, and their eventual emergence back at the surface where they are subjected to weathering, thereby continuing the cycle. It encompasses the concepts of sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, the role of heat and pressure in their transformation, and the overarching cycle of rock creation, alteration, and renewal that characterizes the rock cycle."
