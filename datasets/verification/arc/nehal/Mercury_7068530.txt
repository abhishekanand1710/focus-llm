Model Answer: {
    "answer": "faulting",
    "reasoning": "The uplifting of the Rocky Mountains is most directly attributed to faulting. This geological process involves the fracture and movement of the Earth's crust due to tectonic forces, leading to the formation and uplifting of mountain ranges. While glaciation, flooding, and erosion play significant roles in shaping the landscape over time, including that of the Rocky Mountains, they are more related to the modification of terrain rather than the initial uplifting of mountain ranges."
