Question: Many houses are built on the sides of hills. Which of these actions would best prevent houses from sliding down hills after heavy rainfalls?
Options: ['increasing the slope of the hill', 'spraying herbicides on the hill', 'adding plants to the hill', 'removing grass from the hill']

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "adding plants to the hill",
    "reasoning": "Adding plants to the hill would enhance slope stability by increasing vegetation cover. Vegetation, especially through its root systems, plays a crucial role in anchoring soil particles, thus reducing soil erosion and the risk of slope failure. This is particularly important in areas prone to heavy rainfall, where the loss of topsoil and increased water saturation can significantly increase the risk of landslides. On the contrary, actions like spraying herbicides would kill existing vegetation, increasing erosion risk, while increasing the slope's steepness or removing grass would further destabilize the slope."
