Model Answer: {
    "answer": "its temperature and pH",
    "reasoning": "Temperature and pH are crucial factors that directly affect the health of a lake. Temperature influences the lake's biological activity and the solubility of gases, while pH affects the availability of nutrients and toxins to aquatic life, making these parameters the best indicators of a lake's health as a source of freshwater."
