Model Answer: {
    "answer": "sunlight",
    "reasoning": "Grass gets its energy from the sunlight through the process of photosynthesis, where it converts sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen, providing the energy it needs to grow and sustain itself. Other options like soil, water, and air are involved in the process, but the primary source of energy is sunlight, making 'sunlight' the correct answer."
