        "name": "nonrenewable resource",
        "description": "A natural resource that cannot be readily replaced by natural means at a quick enough pace to keep up with consumption."
    },
    {
        "name": "renewable resource",

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "oil",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, oil is the only nonrenewable resource. It is a fossil fuel that takes millions of years to form, and once used, it cannot be replenished on a human timescale. Trees, solar energy, and food crops are considered renewable resources because they can either be replanted, regrown, or continuously harnessed without depleting the Earth's supply."
