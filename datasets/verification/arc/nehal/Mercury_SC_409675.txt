Key: Mercury_SC_409675

Question: A scientist put several different plants in a sealed container. Every hour, she checked the oxygen in the container to see if it changed. How did the oxygen in the container most likely change?
Options: ['The amount of oxygen increased.', 'The amount of oxygen decreased.', 'The oxygen was transformed into water.', 'The oxygen was transformed into carbon dioxide.']
Answer: The amount of oxygen increased.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The amount of oxygen increased.",
    "reasoning": "Given the setup described in the question, it is likely that the plants inside the sealed container were exposed to light, thus undergoing photosynthesis. During this process, plants consume carbon dioxide and, with the aid of light, convert it into glucose for food and release oxygen as a by-product. Even though plants also respire, consuming oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, the net effect during the daylight hours (or when light is present) tends to be an increase in oxygen due to the predominance of photosynthesis over respiration. Therefore, it is most plausible that the amount of oxygen inside the sealed container increased over time."
