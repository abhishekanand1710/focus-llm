Question: In living things, smaller substances are linked to make up larger substances. Which of the following correctly describes a larger substance made by linking smaller substances?
Options: ['Nucleotides are linked to make up DNA.', 'Amino acids are linked to make up DNA.', 'Proteins are linked to make up nucleotides.', 'Nucleic acids are linked to make up proteins.']
Answer: Nucleotides are linked to make up DNA.

        "related_concept": "Proteins",
        "description": "Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, do not make up proteins; they are separate types of molecules."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Nucleotides are linked to make up DNA.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the provided relationships and definitions, nucleotides are the small building blocks that link together to form DNA, which is a larger molecule responsible for carrying genetic information. This matches the description and correct option provided, aligning with the fundamental concepts of molecular biology."
