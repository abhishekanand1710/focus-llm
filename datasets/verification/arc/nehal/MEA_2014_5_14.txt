    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "110 g",
    "reasoning": "According to the principle of addition of masses, when 10 grams of sugar is dissolved in 100 grams of water, the total mass of the resulting solution is simply the sum of the mass of sugar and the mass of water. Thus, 10 g (sugar) + 100 g (water) = 110 g. Therefore, the mass of the sugar-and-water solution is 110 grams."
