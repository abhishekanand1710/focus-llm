    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "absorbing light",
    "reasoning": "Leaves are the primary photosynthetic organs of a plant, which involves absorbing light to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. This process is essential to the survival of the plant and forms the base of the food chain. The other options, such as absorbing food, producing flowers, and making seeds, are not the primary functions of leaves but rather involve other parts of a plant."
