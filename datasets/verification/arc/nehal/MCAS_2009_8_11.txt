Question: Comparing the skeletons of which of the following fish would best show the evolution of a fish species?
Options: ['a male fish and a female fish that could produce offspring', 'the same fish just before it received a cut and after it healed', 'a fish that lived recently and a fish that lived a long time ago', 'the same fish just after it hatched and when it was full-grown']
Answer: a fish that lived recently and a fish that lived a long time ago

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a fish that lived recently and a fish that lived a long time ago",
    "reasoning": "To best observe the evolution of a fish species, comparing the skeletons of a fish that lived recently and a fish that lived a long time ago is most effective. This comparison allows us to see the physical changes and adaptations that have occurred over a significant period of time, reflecting the process of evolution. In contrast, looking at differences between male and female fish, before and after an injury, or from juvenile to adult within the same individual, would primarily show sexual dimorphism, healing processes, or individual development, none of which directly reflect evolutionary changes across the species over time."
