]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "0.36 Hz",
    "reasoning": "Using the formula for wave speed, which is speed = frequency * wavelength, we can rearrange this formula to solve for frequency, giving us frequency = speed / wavelength. Plugging in the given speed of 18 m/s and a wavelength of 50 m, we get frequency = 18 / 50 = 0.36 Hz. Therefore, the correct answer from the options given is '0.36 Hz'. This calculation directly involves the concepts of speed, frequency, and wavelength as related to ocean waves, using their defined relationships to derive the frequency of the waves."
