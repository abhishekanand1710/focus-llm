Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Bacteria help break down food.",
    "reasoning": "Among the options given, the one that accurately describes a beneficial role of bacteria in the human body is their involvement in breaking down food. This is facilitated by certain bacteria that reside in the digestive system, aiding in the complex process of food digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste removal. This directly correlates with the relationship between 'Bacteria' and 'Digestive system' and the essential function of 'Breaking down food' within the 'Human body'. The other options, while important bodily functions, are not directly influenced by bacteria."
