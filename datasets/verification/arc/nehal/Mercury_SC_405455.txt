Key: Mercury_SC_405455

Question: New engine technology has helped cars get more mileage per gallon of gas. Since gasoline comes from oil, this technology will affect the world supply of oil by
Options: ['increasing the need to search for more oil.', 'reducing the time it takes for oil to be renewed.', 'decreasing the amount of oil that exists underground.', 'extending the time that oil will be available for people to use.']
Answer: extending the time that oil will be available for people to use.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "extending the time that oil will be available for people to use.",
    "reasoning": "New engine technology improves mileage per gallon of gas, meaning vehicles can travel further on less fuel. This directly leads to a reduction in the consumption of oil, as gasoline is derived from oil. Consequently, with reduced oil consumption, the existing supplies of oil will last longer, extending the time that oil will be available for global use. Therefore, the correct answer is that this technology extends the timeframe during which oil reserves will be available for people to use."
