    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ft, yd, mi",
    "reasoning": "All options except 'ft, yd, mi' are units used in the metric system. 'ft (feet), yd (yards), mi (miles)' are units of measurement used in the imperial system, which measures length or distance. Hence, 'ft, yd, mi' does not contain metric units of measurement."
