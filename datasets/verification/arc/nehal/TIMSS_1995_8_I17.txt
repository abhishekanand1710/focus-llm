Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Sun's radiation",
    "reasoning": "The Sun's radiation is the primary source of energy for the Earth's water cycle. It provides the necessary energy for the evaporation of water from the Earth's surface, which is a crucial beginning step for the water cycle. This initiates the continuous movement of water into the atmosphere, where it condenses into clouds and eventually falls back to the Earth as precipitation. Although factors like wind, Earth's radiation, and the Sun's gravity play roles in the Earth's climate and water movement, the initiating and driving force behind the water cycle's continuous process is the Sun's radiation."
