Question: In a series of chemical reactions, X→Y→Z→A, X converts to Y, Y converts to Z, and Z converts to A. Which term describes the process if the production of A interferes with the conversion of X to Y?
Options: ['a complimentary response', 'a control system', 'negative feedback', 'positive feedback']

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "negative feedback",
    "reasoning": "The production of A interferes with the conversion of X to Y, acting to regulate or dampen the process. This is characteristic of a negative feedback mechanism, where the end product of a series of reactions inhibits an earlier step to regulate the amount of product formed and maintain system equilibrium."
