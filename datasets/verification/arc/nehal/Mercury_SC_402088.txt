Model Answer: {
    "answer": "blend in with its surroundings.",
    "reasoning": "The concepts and relationships identified indicate that the Arctic fox undergoes fur color change as a survival adaptation. This change helps the fox to camouflage according to the seasonal environment, thus enabling it to blend in with its surroundings in both the summer and winter seasons for effective hunting and evasion from predators."
