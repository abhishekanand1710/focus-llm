Question: The composition of soil influences the soil's ability to retain and transmit water and air. What soil type would be best for planting a productive garden?
Options: ['Sandy soils because they provide high silica content.', 'Loamy soils because they contain sand and clay.', 'Slightly rocky soils because they provide needed minerals.', 'Clay soils because they are heavy soils and retain water.']
Answer: Loamy soils because they contain sand and clay.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Loamy soils because they contain sand and clay.",
    "reasoning": "Loamy soils are optimal for a productive garden as they offer the necessary balance between water retention and drainage. This soil type combines the beneficial properties of sandy soils (high drainage) and clay soils (high water retention), ensuring that plants receive adequate water without the risk of waterlogging. Additionally, the mix of sand, silt, and clay in loamy soils supports a wide range of plant life by providing an ideal environment for root growth and nutrient uptake. Unlike sandy, rocky, or purely clay soils, loamy soils do not excessively retain water nor drain it too quickly, making them the most conducive for a healthy and productive garden."
