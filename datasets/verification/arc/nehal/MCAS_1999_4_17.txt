Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ship or airplane",
    "reasoning": "Given the need to move products across the ocean from Boston to Europe, the viable options that cater to long-distance and overseas transport are ship and airplane. Ships are designed for carrying goods across oceans, making them a suitable choice for sea transport. Airplanes provide a faster alternative for transporting goods over long distances, including across the Atlantic Ocean. Trucks and tunnels, conversely, are not feasible for oceanic crossings due to their inherent limitations to land travel and subterranean passage, respectively."
