Question: Read the description of the experiment below to answer the question. One hundred pea seeds were put in petri dishes and covered with wet paper towels. The petri dishes were then put inside black plastic bags. Half of them were placed in an incubator set to 10°C. The remaining half were placed in an incubator set to 30°C. This experiment was most likely designed to study the effect of which variable on the germination of pea seeds?
Options: ['temperature', 'water', 'light', 'seed type']
Answer: temperature

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "temperature",
    "reasoning": "This experiment was designed to study the effect of temperature on the germination of pea seeds. The seeds were placed in conditions that were identical except for the temperature, with half of them in an incubator set to 10\u00b0C and the other half set to 30\u00b0C. The use of wet paper towels and black plastic bags indicates that other factors like moisture and light were controlled to focus solely on the impact of temperature on germination."
