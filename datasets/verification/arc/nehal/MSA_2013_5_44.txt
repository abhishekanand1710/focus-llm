Question: A ship leaks a large amount of oil near a coastal area. Which statement describes how the oil most likely will affect the coastal habitat?
Options: ['Fish reproduction rates will increase.', 'Water birds will be unable to use their wings.', 'Water plants will be exposed to more sunlight.', 'Coastal plants will have access to more nutrients.']
Answer: Water birds will be unable to use their wings.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Water birds will be unable to use their wings.",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, the effect of an oil spill making water birds unable to use their wings is the most direct and scientifically supported consequence. Oil from spills adheres to the feathers of birds, hindering their ability to regulate their body temperature and fly. This not only affects their mobility but also can lead to hypothermia or overexposure to the sun, and ultimately, it affects their survival and reproductive capability. None of the other options are immediate or primary effects of oil on coastal environments."
