Question: Laura adds 50 mL of boiling water to 100 mL of ice water. If the 150 mL of water is then put into a freezer, at what temperature will the water freeze?
Options: ['0°C', '15°C', '37°C', '50°C']
Answer: 0°C

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "0\u00b0C",
    "reasoning": "The process of freezing water is not dependent on the initial temperature of the water (whether it's boiling or ice water originally) once mixed; it eventually reaches the ambient temperature of the freezer. The critical temperature at which water turns to ice is its freeze point, which is 0\u00b0C under standard conditions. Regardless of the starting temperatures of the water added together, once the mixed water is placed in a freezer, it will freeze at the water freeze point, which is 0\u00b0C."
