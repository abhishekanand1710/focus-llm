Question: Four solid balls, each with a different mass, are moving at the same speed. Which ball would require the most force to stop its motion?
Options: ['ball with a mass of 5 kg', 'ball with a mass of 10 kg', 'ball with a mass of 15 kg', 'ball with a mass of 20 kg']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ball with a mass of 20 kg",
    "reasoning": "Since all balls are moving at the same speed but have different masses, stopping each ball's motion requires applying a force. According to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the force required to change an object's motion is directly proportional to its mass when the change in velocity is constant. Therefore, the ball with the largest mass (20 kg) will require the most force to stop its motion."
