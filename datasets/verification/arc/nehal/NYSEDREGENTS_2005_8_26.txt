Question: Several tomato plants are grown indoors next to a sunny window. The plants receive water and fertilizer and remain on the windowsill. What will most likely happen?
Options: ['Most of the leaves on the window side will wilt and die.', 'The roots of the plants will grow upward from the soil.', 'Water droplets will collect on the leaves facing away from the window.', 'The stem will bend toward the window.']
Answer: The stem will bend toward the window.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The stem will bend toward the window.",
    "reasoning": "Given that the tomato plants are placed next to a sunny window and are receiving adequate water and fertilizer, they will demonstrate positive phototropism, where the stems grow towards the source of light for photosynthesis. This is because plants have a natural tendency to grow towards light, which helps them maximize the energy they can capture for photosynthesis. Therefore, 'The stem will bend toward the window' is the most likely outcome as it aligns with the natural response of plants to light."
