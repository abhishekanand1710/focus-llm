Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a larger power source",
    "reasoning": "Based on the outlined concepts and relationships, increasing the size or power of the power source directly correlates with an increase in the strength of an electromagnet. More electric current increases the magnetic field, whereas options like longer wires, fewer wire coils, and an aluminum core do not directly contribute to increasing electromagnet strength in this context. Specifically, fewer wire coils would actually decrease the strength, an aluminum core is non-magnetic and thus not effective, and longer wires without additional coils do not inherently increase strength."
