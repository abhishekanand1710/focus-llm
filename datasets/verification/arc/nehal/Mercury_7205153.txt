Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a definite volume.",
    "reasoning": "Both a small, solid sample and a large, liquid sample of aluminum possess a definite volume. This is because both solids and liquids have a constant volume regardless of their shape; solids have a fixed volume due to their rigid structure, and liquids maintain a constant volume that is independent of the shape of their container."
