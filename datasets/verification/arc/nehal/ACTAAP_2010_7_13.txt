Question: Which best describes two organ systems working together to help maintain homeostasis?
Options: ['The reproductive organs produce sex cells.', 'The nerves carry signals from the eye to the brain.', 'The bones and muscles of the hand work together to grip a pencil.', 'The muscles of the chest tighten to push carbon dioxide out of the lungs.']
Answer: The muscles of the chest tighten to push carbon dioxide out of the lungs.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The muscles of the chest tighten to push carbon dioxide out of the lungs.",
    "reasoning": "This option best illustrates two organ systems \u2013 the muscular system and the respiratory system \u2013 working together to maintain homeostasis. The muscular system's involvement through the chest muscles tightening collaborates with the respiratory system's function of expelling carbon dioxide, a key process in maintaining the body\u2019s internal balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels."
