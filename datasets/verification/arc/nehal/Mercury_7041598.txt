Question: Which is the best explanation why the remains of a small reptile living millions of years ago have been found only in Brazil and South Africa?
Options: ['subduction', 'plate tectonics', 'mass extinction', 'converging boundaries']
Answer: plate tectonics

Model Response:
Concepts: [
    {
        "name": "subduction",
        "description": "The process by which one tectonic plate moves under another, sinking into the mantle as the plates converge."
    },
    {
        "name": "plate tectonics",
        "description": "A scientific theory describing the large-scale motion of seven large plates and the movements of a larger number of smaller plates of the Earth's lithosphere."
    },
    {
        "name": "mass extinction",
        "description": "A significant global decrease in the diversity and abundance of life on Earth, typically occurring rapidly in the geological time scale."
    },
    {
        "name": "converging boundaries",
        "description": "Regions where two tectonic plates are moving towards each other, often causing one plate to dive beneath the other."

        "concept": "plate tectonics",
        "relationship": "does not directly explain",
        "related_concept": "mass extinction",
        "description": "While plate tectonics can influence biodiversity and biogeography, it is not a direct cause of mass extinction."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "plate tectonics",
    "reasoning": "The best explanation for finding the remains of a small reptile living millions of years ago only in Brazil and South Africa is 'plate tectonics'. This is because the continents of South America and Africa were once part of the same landmass, known as Gondwana. Plate tectonics explains how continental drift has occurred over millions of years, leading to the present positions of continents. This historical connection accounts for similar fossils being found in locations that are now distant but were once connected."
