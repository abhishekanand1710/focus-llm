Model Answer: {
    "answer": "track the relationship between two variables over time.",
    "reasoning": "Among the presented options, line graphs are best suited for tracking the relationship between two variables over time. They are designed to display progressive changes by connecting individual data points with lines, making it easy to observe trends, patterns, or fluctuations in the relationship between these variables over a designated period. Other options like comparing many variables or displaying data as parts of a whole are better served by different types of charts, such as bar charts or pie charts respectively. Therefore, based on the relationship identified, tracking the relationship between two variables over time is the most appropriate use of a line graph."
