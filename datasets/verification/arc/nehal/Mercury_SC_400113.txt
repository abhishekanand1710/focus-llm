Key: Mercury_SC_400113

Question: A teacher mixes a small amount of salt in a glass of warm water and asks the students to observe physical changes that occur as the salt dissolves. Which physical change will they most likely observe?
Options: ['The solution will become clear.', 'The salt will form bubbles.', 'The solution will increase in temperature.', 'The water will evaporate.']
Answer: The solution will become clear.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The solution will become clear.",
    "reasoning": "As salt dissolves in water, a physical change occurs where the salt (solute) disperses throughout the water (solvent) to form a homogeneous solution. This solution remains clear because dissolution is a process where the solute becomes completely integrated into the solvent without changing the chemical composition of either. Bubbles forming, temperature increase, or water evaporation are not typically observed as direct results of salt dissolving in water under normal circumstances."
