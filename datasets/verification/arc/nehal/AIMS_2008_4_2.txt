Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The plant has flowers.",
    "reasoning": "The statement 'The plant has flowers.' is an observation as it directly notices or describes a perceivable aspect of the plant, specifically its flowers. Unlike the other statements which involve subjective assessment ('The plant is very pretty.'), predictive or speculative nature ('The plant will grow berries.', 'The plant might be poisonous.'), observing that a plant has flowers is a direct, immediate, and verifiable statement about its physical attributes."
