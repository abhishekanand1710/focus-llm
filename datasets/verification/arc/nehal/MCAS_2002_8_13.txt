Question: Why do areas in the middle of a large continent generally have more extreme differences in temperature than areas near the coastline?
Options: ['There are generally more clouds near the oceans.', 'Landlocked areas are usually at a lower altitude than coastline areas.', 'Coastlines are usually surrounded by mountains that block air masses.', 'Oceans change temperature slowly and regulate the temperature of nearby land.']
Answer: Oceans change temperature slowly and regulate the temperature of nearby land.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Oceans change temperature slowly and regulate the temperature of nearby land.",
    "reasoning": "The concepts and their relationships highlight that areas near coastlines benefit from the ocean's slow-changing temperatures, which help regulate and moderate the land's temperature, preventing extreme variations. In contrast, areas in the middle of large continents do not have this moderating influence, leading to more extreme temperatures."
