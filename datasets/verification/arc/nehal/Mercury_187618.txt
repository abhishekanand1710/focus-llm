Question: Where does the energy from an earthquake originate?
Options: ['from a sudden increase in solar radiation striking Earth', "from the Moon's gravitational pull during a close orbit", 'from rocks under stress shifting deep inside Earth', 'from the weight of sediments pushing down on bedrock']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "from rocks under stress shifting deep inside Earth",
    "reasoning": "The energy from an earthquake originates from the shifting of rocks under stress deep within Earth. This is a direct result of geological processes where the Earth's tectonic plates move and create stress on rocks, leading to their sudden shift. This process releases significant amounts of energy, resulting in what we experience as an earthquake. Other options, like solar radiation, the Moon's gravitational pull, or the weight of sediments, do not directly cause earthquakes but may contribute to geological stress in minor ways."
