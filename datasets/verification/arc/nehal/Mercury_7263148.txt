    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "endocrine system",
    "reasoning": "The endocrine system mirrors the cellular process of signal transmission from the cell membrane to the nucleus through its use of hormones. Hormones act as special molecules that carry messages through the bloodstream to various parts of the body, including targeting specific genes within the nucleus of cells, to control and regulate bodily functions. This is analogous to the described intracellular signaling process, making the endocrine system the correct answer."
