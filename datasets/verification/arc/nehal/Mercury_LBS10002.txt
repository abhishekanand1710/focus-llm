Question: The following mathematical expressions represent four different concentrations of a chemical solution to be used in a science experiment. Which one is equal in magnitude to 1/1000?
Options: ['1.0 x 10^3', '1.0 x 10^4', '1.0 x 10^-3', '1.0 x 10^-4']
Answer: 1.0 x 10^-3

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "1.0 x 10^-3",
    "reasoning": "The fraction 1/1000 equals 0.001 in decimal form. This is equivalent to 1.0 x 10^-3 in scientific notation, which represents the same magnitude as the fraction. None of the other options, 1.0 x 10^3, 1.0 x 10^4, or 1.0 x 10^-4, represent the same magnitude. 1.0 x 10^-3 is the correct answer because it directly translates to 1/1000 in terms of magnitude, making use of the concepts of scientific notation and magnitude representation."
