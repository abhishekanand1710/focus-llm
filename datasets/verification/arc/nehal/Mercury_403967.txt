Model Answer: {
    "answer": "105 grams",
    "reasoning": "According to the Law of Conservation of Mass, the total mass before and after a chemical reaction must remain constant if the system is closed, meaning no mass is lost to the environment. In this scenario, 100 grams of vinegar react with 5 grams of baking soda, giving a total initial mass of 105 grams. As the gas produced is trapped within the container, no mass is lost, and thus the final mass of the products, including the trapped gas, remains 105 grams. Hence, '105 grams' is the correct answer."
