Key: Mercury_189560

Question: An increase in phosphate levels in a lake increases the population of algae in the lake. Increased algae blocks sunlight into the lake and results in a decrease in dissolved oxygen in the lake's water. Which of the following should be expected as a result?
Options: ['Plant populations in the lake increase.', 'More predatory birds feed on lake animals.', 'Phosphate levels in the lake decrease.', 'Fish populations in the lake decline.']
Answer: Fish populations in the lake decline.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Fish populations in the lake decline.",
    "reasoning": "The increase in phosphate levels leads to an increase in algae population, which then blocks sunlight from entering the lake. The reduced sunlight penetration decreases the levels of dissolved oxygen, which is crucial for fish survival, leading to a decline in fish populations."
