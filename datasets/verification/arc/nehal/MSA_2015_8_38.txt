Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Hot soup warms a metal spoon handle.",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, the process of warming a metal spoon handle when it is placed in hot soup is an example of heat transfer mainly by conduction. Conduction occurs because the heat from the soup is directly transferred to the spoon's handle through the material of the spoon, without the movement of the soup itself. This differs from radiation and convection, where heat is transferred through electromagnetic waves without requiring a medium or by the movement of fluid, respectively."
