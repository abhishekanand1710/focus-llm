    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a physical adaptation",
    "reasoning": "The seasonal color change in male goldfinches is a physical adaptation designed to enhance their breeding success by making them more attractive to females during the breeding season. This change is a regular, biological process that occurs each year, not a result of genetic mutations, learned behaviors, or behavioral adaptations."
