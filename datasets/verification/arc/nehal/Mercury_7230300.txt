Question: The Late Heavy Bombardment was a period of extensive comet impact on Earth about 3.8 billion years ago. Scientists believe this period provided much of the matter now found in which part of the Earth system?
Options: ['core', 'mantle', 'atmosphere', 'hydrosphere']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "hydrosphere",
    "reasoning": "The Late Heavy Bombardment, characterized by extensive comet impacts on Earth about 3.8 billion years ago, is believed to have provided much of the matter now found in the Earth's hydrosphere. This is because comets are mainly composed of ice and organic compounds, which upon impact would have contributed significantly to the Earth's water and possibly to the emergence of life by adding water and organic materials to Earth's surface. None of the other listed components, such as the core, mantle, or atmosphere, directly correlate with the introduction of water and organic compounds from comets."
