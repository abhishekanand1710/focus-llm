Question: A mouse is homozygous for black fur (BB). The other parent is heterozygous for black fur with a recessive trait for brown fur ( Bb ). If black is the dominant trait, what percentage of the offspring will be brown?
Options: ['100%', '50%', '25%', '0%']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "0%",
    "reasoning": "Since one parent is homozygous for black fur (BB) and the dominant trait is black fur, it can only pass on the allele for black fur. The other parent, being heterozygous (Bb), has a 50% chance of passing on the allele for black fur and a 50% chance of passing on the allele for brown fur. However, since the black fur allele is dominant, any offspring receiving at least one black fur allele (B) from either parent will have black fur. As the offspring need to inherit the recessive brown allele (b) from both parents to express brown fur and one parent is homozygous BB (can only provide B), no offspring will express the phenotype for brown fur. Therefore, 0% of the offspring will be brown."
