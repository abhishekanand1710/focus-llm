Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the semiliquid physical state",
    "reasoning": "The semiliquid physical state of the asthenosphere is crucial for the movement of crustal plates. This physical characteristic allows the plates to move over it, which is fundamental to our understanding of plate tectonics and crustal-plate motion. The other options, while related to geologic or solar activities, do not directly explain the evidence of crustal-plate motion."
