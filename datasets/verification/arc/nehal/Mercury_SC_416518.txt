Question: A mountain with a melting glacier has a stream with a waterfall. The waterfall fills a lake at the base of the mountain. Where is the water coldest?
Options: ['glacier', 'stream', 'waterfall', 'lake']
Answer: glacier

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "glacier",
    "reasoning": "The glacier, as the source of the melting ice, would have the coldest temperature because it is a mass of ice. As water flows away from the glacier (through the stream, over the waterfall, and into the lake), it would gradually warm up due to ambient temperatures, exposure to sunlight, and mixing with warmer air and water. Therefore, the water is coldest at its source, which is the glacier."
