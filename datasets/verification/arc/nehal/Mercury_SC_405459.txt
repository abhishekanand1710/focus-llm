Question: Corn can be used to make ethanol, which is a fuel for some cars. What problem could be caused by the increased use of ethanol?
Options: ['increase in fossil fuel production', 'decrease in corn production', 'increase in severe weather', 'decrease in nutrients in soil']
Answer: decrease in nutrients in soil

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "decrease in nutrients in soil",
    "reasoning": "Relying on corn for ethanol production can lead to intensive agriculture practices that often increase the depletion of key nutrients in the soil. This occurs because corn farming, especially when done continuously on the same land for biofuel production, requires significant amounts of nutrients, which are removed from the soil and can result in decreased soil fertility over time. This is directly related to the increased use of ethanol made from corn."
