Question: Which question can most likely be determined through a scientific investigation?
Options: ['Who will be the winner of the next lottery?', 'What football team will win the next game?', 'What is the amount of light needed to grow tomatoes?', 'Which four types of bird feathers have the prettiest colors?']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "What is the amount of light needed to grow tomatoes?",
    "reasoning": "This question can be determined through scientific investigation because it involves understanding and quantifying the light requirements\u2014a measurable and observable factor\u2014for the optimal growth of tomato plants. Unlike the other options, which involve unpredictable events or subjective judgments, the study of plant growth factors like light can be systematically experimented and observed through scientific methods."
