Question: A gene mutates in a type of bacteria. When these bacteria reproduce asexually, this mutation can only be inherited by
Options: ['different types of bacteria.', 'cells in the bacteria that are non-reproductive.', 'bacteria cells that are missing the gene.', 'direct descendants of the bacteria.']
Answer: direct descendants of the bacteria.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "direct descendants of the bacteria.",
    "reasoning": "Given the nature of asexual reproduction in bacteria, wherein offspring are genetically identical to their parent organism, genetic mutations present in the parent bacteria are inherited specifically by its direct descendants. This process of inheritance ensures that mutations are passed down directly, rather than to different types of bacteria, non-reproductive cells within the bacteria, or bacteria cells missing the gene. The relationships outlined make it clear that the mutation's inheritance is strictly through the lineage of direct descendants arising from the asexual reproduction of the mutated bacteria."
