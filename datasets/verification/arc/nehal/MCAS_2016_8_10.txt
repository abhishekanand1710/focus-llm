Question: A crop of corn plants is genetically modified so that the plants produce a natural pesticide. People are concerned that these corn plants might transfer modified genetic material to other plants. Which of the following is the best way to further modify the plants to prevent them from transferring their genetic materials to other plants?
Options: ['changing the plants so they do not make pollen', 'changing the plants so they do not harm insects', 'changing the plants so they cannot produce nutrients', 'changing the plants so they cannot be easily identified']
Answer: changing the plants so they do not make pollen

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "changing the plants so they do not make pollen",
    "reasoning": "Since pollen is identified as a vehicle for the transfer of genetic material between plants, changing the genetically modified corn plants so they do not produce pollen would be the best way to prevent them from transferring modified genetic material to other plants. This approach directly addresses the medium (pollen) through which gene transfer occurs, effectively hindering the possibility of horizontal gene transfer to non-target plants."
