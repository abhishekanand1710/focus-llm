Question: A flowing stream contains water at 18°C. Cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into the stream. Which of the following will most likely occur?
Options: ["The soft drink cans will absorb cold energy from the stream's water.", "The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's.", 'The temperature of the soft drinks will not change since the cans are sealed.', 'The temperature of the cans will decrease to freezing as long as the stream is flowing.']
Answer: The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's.",
    "reasoning": "When the cans of soft drinks at 28\u00b0C are lowered into the stream with water at 18\u00b0C, heat transfer occurs from the warmer cans to the cooler water. This process, primarily involving conduction and assisted by convection currents in the water, continues until the temperature of the soft drink cans and the water reach an equilibrium point. This means the cans will cool down to match the stream's temperature of 18\u00b0C, not absorb 'cold energy' (since cold is merely the absence of heat), change temperature despite being sealed (since the transfer is through the can material), or decrease to freezing just because the stream is flowing."
