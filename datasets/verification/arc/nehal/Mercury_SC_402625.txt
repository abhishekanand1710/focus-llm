Model Answer: {
    "answer": "reflection.",
    "reasoning": "When a mirror is placed by a fish bowl with a beta fish swimming inside, the beta fish sees what appears to be another fish due to the phenomenon of reflection. This occurs because mirrors reflect light and images without absorbing them, creating a clear image of whatever is in front of them. In this scenario, the mirror reflects the image of the beta fish, making it appear as though another fish is present."
