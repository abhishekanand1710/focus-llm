Question: Which of the following would make the best insulator against the flow of electricity?
Options: ['copper wire', 'steel tubing', 'plastic tape', 'aluminum foil']
Answer: plastic tape

Model Response:
Concepts: [
    {
        "name": "copper wire",
        "description": "A conductor of electricity commonly used in electrical wiring."
    },
    {
        "name": "steel tubing",
        "description": "A type of metal tube; conducts electricity but less so than copper."
    },
    {
        "name": "plastic tape",
        "description": "A type of tape made from plastic, known for its insulating properties against electricity."
    },
    {
        "name": "aluminum foil",
        "description": "A thin sheet of aluminum, conducts electricity."
    }

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "plastic tape",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, plastic tape is the only material that does not conduct electricity, making it an effective insulator. In contrast, copper wire, steel tubing, and aluminum foil are all conductors of electricity."
