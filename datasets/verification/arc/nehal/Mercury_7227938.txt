Model Answer: {
    "answer": "which genes are active",
    "reasoning": "During embryo development, cell differentiation is influenced by which genes are activated in a particular cell. Gene activation determines the function and specialization of the cell by influencing the types of proteins produced, thus guiding the development of the embryo into a complex multicellular organism. The presence, number, and types of proteins produced are subsequent effects of which genes are active in the cells."
