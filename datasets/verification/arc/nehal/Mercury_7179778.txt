Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the light produced by magnesium when burned",
    "reasoning": "The light produced by magnesium when burned is a direct indication of a chemical reaction taking place, specifically the reaction of magnesium with oxygen from the air to produce magnesium oxide, accompanied by the emission of light. This is evidence of a chemical reaction because it involves a transformation of substances and release of energy in the form of light, whereas the other options represent either physical changes or processes not directly indicating a chemical reaction."
