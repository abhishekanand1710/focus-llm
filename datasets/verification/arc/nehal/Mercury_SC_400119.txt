Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The wire will become warmer.",
    "reasoning": "As electric current flows through a wire in a properly working electrical circuit, it encounters resistance. This resistance generates heat due to the opposition to the flow of electrons, resulting in the wire becoming warmer. This is a common and expected outcome, making it the correct change that will occur in the wire."
