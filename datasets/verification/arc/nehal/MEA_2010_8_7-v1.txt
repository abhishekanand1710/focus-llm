Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They change solar energy into chemical energy.",
    "reasoning": "The process of photosynthesis in giant redwood trees involves the absorption of solar energy and its conversion into chemical energy, which is stored in the cells of the trees. This process is fundamental to the energy transformation highlighted in the correct option."
