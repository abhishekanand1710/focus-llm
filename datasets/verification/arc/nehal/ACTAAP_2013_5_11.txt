Question: As part of an experiment, an astronaut takes a scale to the Moon and weighs himself. The scale reads 31 pounds. If the astronaut has a mass of about 84 kilograms, which are the approximate weight and mass of the astronaut when standing on the Earth?
Options: ['31 pounds and 14 kilograms', '31 pounds and 84 kilograms', '186 pounds and 14 kilograms', '186 pounds and 84 kilograms']
Answer: 186 pounds and 84 kilograms

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "186 pounds and 84 kilograms",
    "reasoning": "The astronaut's mass is given as 84 kilograms, and mass remains constant regardless of the gravity. Therefore, the mass on Earth remains 84 kilograms. The weight on the Moon is given as 31 pounds. The gravity on the Moon is about 1/6th that of Earth, meaning an object will weigh 6 times more on Earth. Thus, the astronaut's weight on Earth would be 31 pounds * 6 = 186 pounds. The correct answer, combining the constant mass with the recalculated weight on Earth, is '186 pounds and 84 kilograms.'"
