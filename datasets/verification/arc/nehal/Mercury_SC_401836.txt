Model Answer: {
    "answer": "new season",
    "reasoning": "Based on the listed concepts and their relationships, 'new season' occurs about every three months, marking a division of the year into four distinct periods. This is consistent with the regular, quarterly division of the year, unlike the other options which either occur more frequently or irregularly."
