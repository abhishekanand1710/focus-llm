Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Rain",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, 'Rain' is an example of liquid water. It represents water in its liquid state, falling from the atmosphere to the earth, as opposed to frost and ice which are solid states of water, and steam which is the gaseous state."
