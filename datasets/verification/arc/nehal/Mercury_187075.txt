Key: Mercury_187075

Question: Many cars are equipped with a catalytic converter, a device that helps remove hydrocarbons and oxides from car exhaust. As a result, this device helps to
Options: ['increase the production of ozone.', 'decrease the production of smog.', 'increase the emission of nitrogen.', 'decrease the emission of carbon dioxide.']
Answer: decrease the production of smog.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "decrease the production of smog.",
    "reasoning": "The catalytic converter reduces harmful emissions by converting hydrocarbons and oxides, which are major contributors to smog formation, into less harmful substances. Thus, it indirectly decreases the production of smog by treating the pollutants that contribute to smog formation."
