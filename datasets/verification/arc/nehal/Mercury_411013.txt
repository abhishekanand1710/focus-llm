Question: A male fruit fly is homozygous dominant for gray-body color (G) and is crossed with a female fruit fly that is homozygous recessive for ebony-body color (g). What are the probable phenotypes of the offspring?
Options: ['25% gray, 75% ebony', '50% gray, 50% ebony', '100% ebony', '100% gray']
Answer: 100% gray

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "100% gray",
    "reasoning": "The male fruit fly is homozygous dominant for gray-body color, meaning it has two dominant alleles (GG) for this trait. The female fruit fly is homozygous recessive for ebony-body color, carrying two recessive alleles (gg). When these flies are crossed, each offspring receives one allele from each parent. This results in all offspring being heterozygous (Gg), carrying one dominant allele for gray-body color and one recessive allele for ebony-body color. Since the gray-body color allele is dominant, all offspring will exhibit the gray-body phenotype, leading to 100% of the offspring having a gray body color."
