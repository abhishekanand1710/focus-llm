Question: In which taxonomic group are organisms found that share the characteristic of storing hereditary material in a single loop of DNA?
Options: ['bacteria', 'fungi', 'plants', 'animals']
Answer: bacteria

        "description": "The single loop of DNA is a simpler form of genetic material compared to the chromosomal DNA of eukaryotes."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "bacteria",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, bacteria are characterized by having their genetic material stored in a single loop of DNA, which is a distinctive feature of this group. In contrast, fungi, plants, and animals have their DNA arranged in multiple chromosomes within a cell nucleus, adhering to a more complex cellular organization."
