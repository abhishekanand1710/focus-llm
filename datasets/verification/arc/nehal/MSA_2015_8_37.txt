Question: Data in tables may also be presented in graphs. Which type of data would best be displayed on a circle graph?
Options: ['the distance of the planets from the sun', 'the depths of the major oceans on Earth', 'the amount of rainfall each day for a month', 'the percent of various materials in solid waste']
Answer: the percent of various materials in solid waste

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the percent of various materials in solid waste",
    "reasoning": "Circle graphs are most effectively used for displaying data that represents parts of a whole or percentages, which fits the description of displaying the percent of various materials in solid waste. This is because each sector of the circle can represent the proportion of a specific material in the total waste, making it easier to visualize the distribution of different materials compared to other types of data like distances, depths, or daily measurements that do not inherently deal with proportions of a whole."
