    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "motor neurons",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is 'motor neurons' because these are the neurons responsible for conveying impulses from the brain or spinal cord to the muscles to produce movement. As described, the brain sends motor signals specifically through motor neurons to initiate movements in muscles, including those in the arm."
