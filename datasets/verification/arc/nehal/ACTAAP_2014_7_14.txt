        "description": "Cross-pollination in plants is most similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates because it involves the exchange of genetic material between two individuals."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "cross-pollination",
    "reasoning": "Cross-pollination is the process in plants that is most similar to sexual reproduction in vertebrates because it involves the transfer of genetic material between two different individuals, leading to offspring (in this case, seeds) that have genetic contributions from two parents. This is analogous to sexual reproduction in vertebrates, where genetic material from two parents is combined to produce genetically unique offspring."
