    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "sugar",
    "reasoning": "During photosynthesis, plants absorb carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight (facilitated by chlorophyll) and convert them into sugars (like glucose) and oxygen. The sugars produced serve as food for the plant, making 'sugar' the correct answer from the given options."
