Model Answer: {
    "answer": "incomplete metamorphosis",
    "reasoning": "The term 'incomplete metamorphosis' best describes the life cycle of an insect that reaches the adult stage without being a pupa. This development pattern features three stages: egg, nymph, and adult, with no pupa stage involved. Therefore, it directly applies to the context of an insect maturing into an adult without undergoing a pupal phase, unlike the 'complete metamorphosis' process which includes a pupa stage. 'Alternation of generations' and 'spontaneous mutation' are unrelated concepts to the specific developmental stages of insects."
