Question: Two identical plants are planted 3 meters apart. One plant is flowering, but the other is not. A student concludes that the plants are receiving an unequal supply of water. Another possible explanation the other plant is not flowering is that the plants are
Options: ['too close to one another.', 'receiving different amounts of sunlight.', 'in soil with high humus content.', 'receiving different amounts of carbon dioxide.']
Answer: receiving different amounts of sunlight.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "receiving different amounts of sunlight.",
    "reasoning": "Given the distance between the plants (3 meters) is reasonably sufficient to avoid negative impacts of proximity, such as competition for resources, the lack of flowering in one plant compared to another could feasibly be attributed to differences in the amount of sunlight each plant is receiving. Sunlight is crucial for photosynthesis, which in turn supports the energy requirements for flowering. Factors like shadows from nearby objects or variations in sun exposure throughout the day could lead to one plant receiving less sunlight than the other, despite the identical water supply and soil conditions."
