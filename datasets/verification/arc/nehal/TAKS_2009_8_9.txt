Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Limiting the number of cars on the roads",
    "reasoning": "Limiting the number of cars on the roads directly addresses the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere, one of the primary sources of air pollution in large cities. Fewer cars mean fewer emissions, which can lead to a significant improvement in air quality. The other options either increase emissions, such as switching to wood stoves and requiring large vehicles to use diesel fuel, or are more focused on indoor air quality, such as maintaining filters in large buildings, and do not directly reduce outdoor air pollution."
