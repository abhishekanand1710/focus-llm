Question: Which of these do scientists offer as the most recent explanation as to why many plants and animals died out at the end of the Mesozoic era?
Options: ['worldwide disease', 'global mountain building', 'rise of mammals that preyed upon plants and animals', 'impact of an asteroid created dust that blocked the sunlight']
Answer: impact of an asteroid created dust that blocked the sunlight

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "impact of an asteroid created dust that blocked the sunlight",
    "reasoning": "The most widely supported explanation for the mass extinction at the end of the Mesozoic era is the impact of an asteroid. This event is believed to have thrown massive amounts of dust into the atmosphere, blocking sunlight and leading to significant climatic changes that resulted in the extinction of many plant and animal species. The relationships between the asteroid impact, the produced dust blocking sunlight, and the consequences on the environment and existing species are key elements that support this explanation."
