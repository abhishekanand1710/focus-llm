        "description": "The development of a person's intelligence is influenced by both genetic factors and environmental factors such as education, culture, and life experiences."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "intelligence",
    "reasoning": "While height, hair color, and skin color are primarily determined by genetic factors and thus can be considered as inherited traits with little variation aside from hereditary elements, intelligence is markedly influenced by both genetics and environmental factors. The complex interplay between genetic predispositions and external conditions such as education, nutrition, and social surroundings makes intelligence significantly more pliable and less of an inherited trait in the strict sense compared to the other options."
