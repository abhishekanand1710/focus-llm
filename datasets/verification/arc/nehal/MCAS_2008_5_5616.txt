Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Boston is close to an ocean.",
    "reasoning": "The primary reason for the high amount of moisture in the air over Boston is its proximity to the ocean. The ocean is a major source of moisture, as water evaporates from its surface and adds humidity to the air. This explains why coastal areas like Boston tend to have higher humidity levels compared to inland areas."
