    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "energy",
    "reasoning": "Heat, light, and sound are all manifestations of energy, characterized by their unique properties and ways of transmission (atomic and molecular motion for heat, electromagnetic radiation for light, and mechanical vibrations for sound), differing from matter, which is physical substance, fuel, a source of energy, and electricity, which is just one form of energy."
