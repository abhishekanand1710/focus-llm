        "description": "A material with a textured surface, offering more resistance compared to smooth surfaces"
    },
    {
        "name": "Smooth Wood",
        "description": "Wood with a fine, even surface, offering moderate resistance"
    },
    {
        "name": "Wet Plastic",
        "description": "Plastic that has been made slick by moisture, reducing friction"
    },

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "rough paper",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, rough paper will increase friction on a bicycle ramp the most due to its textured surface. High friction is essential for preventing slipping and promoting safety and control on the ramp. The texture of rough paper provides the necessary resistance against the bicycle tires, making it the best choice for enhancing friction."
