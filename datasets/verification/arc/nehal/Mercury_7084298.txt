Model Answer: {
    "answer": "chemical reactivity.",
    "reasoning": "Elements in the same group of the Periodic Table of the Elements share a similar valence electron configuration, which significantly influences their chemical reactivity. The chemical reactivity of elements is more alike among elements in the same group compared to their atomic mass, number of protons, or atomic size. This similarity in chemical reactivity is due to the similar ways these elements interact with other substances, which is rooted in the properties of their valence electrons."
