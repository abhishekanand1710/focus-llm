Question: On Earth, water can be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. Which energy source has the greatest influence on the state of matter of water?
Options: ['the sun', 'the wind', 'ocean currents', 'the metal core']
Answer: the sun

        "relationship": "unrelated",
        "related_concept": "state of matter of water",
        "description": "The metal core's influence on water state is negligible compared to solar energy."
    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the sun",
    "reasoning": "The sun plays the most significant role in influencing the state of matter of water on Earth. It provides the energy required for evaporation, turning liquid water into vapor, and for melting ice, turning it back into liquid. The sun's heat directly affects water's temperature, leading to changes in its state from solid to liquid to gas, far more than wind, ocean currents, or the Earth's metal core."
