    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Leaves -> Caterpillar -> Bird",
    "reasoning": "This option correctly represents the flow of energy in a simple food chain. Energy is produced in leaves through photosynthesis. Caterpillars consume the leaves and transform the stored energy into biomass, which in turn is consumed by birds. The sequence 'Leaves -> Caterpillar -> Bird' illustrates a linear and realistic flow of energy from producers (leaves) to primary consumers (caterpillar) and then to secondary consumers (bird). Other options inaccurately depict the relationship between trees, leaves, and caterpillars or place the organisms in an incorrect order for a simple food chain."
