        "name": "pH scale",
        "description": "A scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of an aqueous solution."
    },
    {
        "name": "Acid",
        "description": "Substances with a pH less than 7 on the pH scale, which donate protons or accept electrons."
    },
    {
        "name": "Basicity",
        "description": "Characterized by substances with a pH greater than 7 on the pH scale."
    },
    {
        "name": "Neutral",
        "description": "Describes a substance with a pH of 7, showing neither acidity nor basicity."
    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "3",
    "reasoning": "According to the pH scale, a lower number indicates a higher level of acidity. Among the options given, '3' is the lowest number, indicating the strongest acid. Acids have a pH less than 7, with numbers getting smaller as the acid gets stronger."
