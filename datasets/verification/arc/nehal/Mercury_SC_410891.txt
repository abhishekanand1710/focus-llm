Question: A student is investigating a light bulb that saves energy and can last up to 10 times longer than other bulbs. Other than saving energy, which is another benefit of using these light bulbs?
Options: ['Drinking water stays clean.', 'Less trash is put in landfills.', 'More nutrients are added to the soil.', 'Fewer chemicals get into the food supply.']
Answer: Less trash is put in landfills.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Less trash is put in landfills.",
    "reasoning": "Energy-saving and long-lasting light bulbs contribute to less waste because they don't need to be replaced as often as standard bulbs. This in turn results in less trash being disposed of in landfills, as there is a direct relationship between the lifespan of these bulbs and the amount of waste generated. Since less frequent replacements are needed, fewer spent bulbs end up in landfills, making 'Less trash is put in landfills' the correct benefit, other than saving energy."
