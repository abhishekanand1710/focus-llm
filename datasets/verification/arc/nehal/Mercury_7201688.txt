Question: Sooj learned that whales use vocalization to navigate and to communicate with other whales. Some scientists think that noise pollution in whale habitats may harm whale populations. What would be the most likely effect of noise pollution on whales?
Options: ['alteration of whale genetic material', 'reversed flow of energy through whale habitats', 'reduced populations of food organisms in whale habitats', 'separation of whale family groups']
Answer: separation of whale family groups

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "separation of whale family groups",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, the effect of noise pollution that directly relates to the way whales use vocalization for communication and navigation, resulting in an immediate impact, is the separation of whale family groups. Noise pollution can interfere with the whales' ability to communicate, which is crucial for maintaining family bonds and coherence, leading to possible separation."
