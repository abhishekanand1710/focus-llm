Key: Mercury_SC_408784

Question: Michael learned that the movement of Earth in the solar system causes changes that can be seen on the planet. Which change could be seen on Earth in the time it takes Earth to rotate once on its axis?
Options: ['day becoming night', 'winter changing to spring', 'January changing to February', 'a new moon becoming a full moon']
Answer: day becoming night

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "day becoming night",
    "reasoning": "The rotation of Earth on its axis is what causes the day to turn into night and vice versa. This rotation takes approximately 24 hours to complete one turn, making 'day becoming night' the change that can be observed on Earth in the time it takes Earth to rotate once on its axis. This process is directly related to Earth's rotation, unlike seasonal changes, monthly shifts, or moon phases, which are related to Earth's orbit around the Sun, the calendar system, or the Moon's orbit around Earth, respectively."
