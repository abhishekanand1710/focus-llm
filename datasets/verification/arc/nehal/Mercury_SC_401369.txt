Question: Members of a planning team build a model of a nearby stream and then block the stream to show how it can form a lake. Which is a limitation of the model?
Options: ['showing how a nearby town will avoid flooding', 'explaining how the lake will be used for recreation', 'explaining how some of the water can be used for agriculture', 'showing how the dam will affect the plants and animals in the area']
Answer: showing how the dam will affect the plants and animals in the area

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "showing how the dam will affect the plants and animals in the area",
    "reasoning": "The limitation of the model in this context lies in its inability to accurately represent the complex and dynamic environmental impacts, specifically on the plants and animals in the area. While modeling can simulate physical transformations and hypothesize about some forms of human use (like recreation or agriculture), predicting the nuanced ecological effects requires more detailed biological and ecological data that such a physical model cannot encompass."
