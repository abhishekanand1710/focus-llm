Question: During the fall reproductive season, the belly of a male brook trout becomes bright orange. The orange belly provides some camouflage and helps attract females. This trait evolved in brook trout because, compared to males with pale bellies, males with bright orange bellies are more likely to
Options: ['live in good habitats.', 'be eaten by predators.', 'mate with other species of fish.', 'fertilize eggs to produce offspring.']
Answer: fertilize eggs to produce offspring.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "fertilize eggs to produce offspring.",
    "reasoning": "The evolution of the bright orange belly in male brook trout during the fall reproductive season is a trait that has developed primarily to attract females. This attraction increases the likelihood of successful mating and fertilization of eggs, which leads to the production of offspring. The presence of this trait suggests that males with bright orange bellies have a reproductive advantage, encouraging the propagation of this trait through subsequent generations. It supports the basic principles of evolution, where traits that enhance reproductive success are more likely to be passed on."
