Question: Acid rain has a pH below 5.6. This rain can damage soil, lakes, crops, and buildings. Acid rain is caused by all of the following except
Options: ['industrial emissions from factories.', 'coal that is burned to produce heat and power.', 'automobile exhaust.', 'nuclear power plants that produce radiation.']
Answer: nuclear power plants that produce radiation.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "nuclear power plants that produce radiation.",
    "reasoning": "Among the options given, the only source that does not contribute directly to the formation of acid rain is 'nuclear power plants that produce radiation.' This is because nuclear power plants do not emit the chemical pollutants (like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) responsible for acid rain. Instead, their primary environmental concern is related to radiation, which does not contribute to acid rain's chemical formation."
