Model Answer: {
    "answer": "beryllium, Be",
    "reasoning": "Based on their locations in the periodic table, elements in the same group generally have similar chemical properties due to their similar outer electron configuration. Both Calcium (Ca) and Beryllium (Be) are in group 2 of the periodic table. Therefore, Beryllium (Be) has chemical properties most similar to those of Calcium (Ca)."
