Question: Farmers plant fruit trees in an area that was once a grassy meadow. Which will most likely happen to the rabbits living in the meadow?
Options: ['They will learn to eat fruit.', 'They will learn to climb trees.', 'The number of their young will increase.', 'The size of their population will decrease.']
Answer: The size of their population will decrease.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The size of their population will decrease.",
    "reasoning": "The transformation of a grassy meadow into an area with fruit trees results in habitat alteration. This change affects the rabbits' living conditions by altering the availability of their traditional food sources and possibly providing less ground cover. Since rabbits are adapted to meadow environments and the specific types of food sources found there, the alteration can lead to a decrease in their population size because their habitat no longer supports their needs as effectively. The other options, such as learning to eat fruit or climb trees, are less likely immediate responses to habitat change and do not directly address the fundamental issue of habitat suitability and food source availability."
