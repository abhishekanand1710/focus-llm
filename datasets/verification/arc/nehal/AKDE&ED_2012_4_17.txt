Question: After observing several dogs running, students ask the following question: Do dogs with long hair run faster than dogs with short hair? How can the students best answer their question?
Options: ['record the weights and heights of many dogs', 'measure the speeds and hair lengths of many dogs', 'research to find the type of dog with the longest hair', 'race one long-haired dog against one short-haired dog']
Answer: measure the speeds and hair lengths of many dogs

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "measure the speeds and hair lengths of many dogs",
    "reasoning": "To accurately answer the question regarding the correlation between a dog's hair length and running speed, it's essential to have specific data on both variables across a variety of dogs. By measuring both the speeds and hair lengths of many dogs, students can analyze the data for any patterns or relationships between these two factors, allowing for a more accurate and comprehensive conclusion."
