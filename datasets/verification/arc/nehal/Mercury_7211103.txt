Model Answer: {
    "answer": "removes valuable habitat for local species",
    "reasoning": "The clearing of rainforests for farmland directly leads to the destruction of habitats that are crucial for the survival of many local species. This loss of habitat is a significant harmful effect of deforestation for agricultural expansion."
