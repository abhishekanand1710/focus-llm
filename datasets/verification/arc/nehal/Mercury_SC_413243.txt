Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It creates a cocoon.",
    "reasoning": "The most significant difference between a moth's life cycle and an insect that goes through incomplete metamorphosis is the creation of a cocoon. Moths undergo complete metamorphosis, which includes a pupal stage where the larva forms a cocoon. In contrast, insects with incomplete metamorphosis do not have a pupal stage and, therefore, do not create cocoons."
