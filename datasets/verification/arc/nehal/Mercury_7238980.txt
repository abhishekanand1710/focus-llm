Question: A "widow's peak" hairline in humans is coded by the dominant allele W. A straight hairline is coded by the recessive allele w. A man with a homozygous dominant WW produces a zygote with a woman with a heterozygous dominant Ww for the trait. Which allele combinations could occur in the zygote?
Options: ['WW or ww', 'WW or Ww', 'WW only', 'Ww only']
Answer: WW or Ww

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "WW or Ww",
    "reasoning": "Since the father is homozygous dominant (WW) and the mother is heterozygous dominant (Ww), the possible allele combinations for the zygote (child) could only be WW or Ww. This is derived from the fact that the father can only pass on a dominant allele (W), while the mother can pass on either a dominant (W) or a recessive allele (w). Thus, the combinations that result are either WW (if the W from both parents is passed on) or Ww (if the father passes on W and the mother passes on w)."
