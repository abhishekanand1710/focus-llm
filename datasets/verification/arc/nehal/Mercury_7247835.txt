Question: Which statement describes how muscles work to allow a person to extend an arm from a curled position by straightening the elbow?
Options: ['Both the biceps and triceps contract.', 'Both the biceps and the triceps relax.', 'The triceps contract and the biceps relax.', 'The biceps contract and the triceps relax.']
Answer: The triceps contract and the biceps relax.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The triceps contract and the biceps relax.",
    "reasoning": "To extend an arm from a curled position by straightening the elbow, the triceps muscle contracts, causing the arm to extend. Simultaneously, the biceps muscle relaxes to allow this movement. This is because the biceps and triceps are antagonistic muscles, meaning that they perform opposite actions; when one contracts, the other relaxes. Therefore, contraction of the triceps along with relaxation of the biceps results in extending the arm."
