Model Answer: {
    "answer": "electromagnetic radiation.",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is 'electromagnetic radiation.' This is because in a light bulb, electrical energy is primarily transformed into light through the process of converting electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation, a portion of which is visible light. This conversion is mediated by the interactions of atoms within the bulb. While some energy is also converted into heat (thermal energy), the primary purpose and function of a light bulb is to produce visible light, which is a form of electromagnetic radiation."
