Model Answer: {
    "answer": "use a dustpan and broom",
    "reasoning": "The use of a dustpan and broom is the safest and most effective option for retrieving broken glass from the floor. It minimizes direct hand contact with the glass, thereby reducing the risk of cuts or injury. Picking up the pieces by hand or with a paper towel poses a higher risk of injury, and a chemical spill kit is not designed for clean-up of non-hazardous materials like glass. Hence, safety and the nature of the material dictate that a dustpan and broom are the best tools for the job."
