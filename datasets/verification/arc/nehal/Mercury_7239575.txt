Model Answer: {
    "answer": "adapt to exploit changed resources",
    "reasoning": "As the environment changes from temperate to tropical, the availability and type of resources (like food and shelter) will also change. The species that can adapt to exploit these changed resources will have a higher probability of survival. This adaptation allows the species to continue thriving in the new environmental conditions by utilizing the resources that are now more abundant or otherwise altered. Interbreeding with similar tropical organisms, reducing energy requirements, or emigrating might provide temporary advantages or be part of the adaptation strategy, but the core element that ensures long-term survival is the capacity to adapt to and exploit the changed resources directly related to the new tropical environment."
