    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Liquid water becomes water vapor.",
    "reasoning": "As the kinetic energy of water molecules increases, the molecules move faster, overcoming their intermolecular forces and transitioning from liquid to gaseous state. This process describes the phase change from liquid water to water vapor, which is supported by the relationship between kinetic energy increase and phase transition."
