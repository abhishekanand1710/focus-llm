]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Earth revolves around the sun.",
    "reasoning": "The changing position of constellations like Leo in the sky throughout the year is due to Earth's revolution around the Sun. This orbit causes different parts of the night sky to become visible as the Earth moves along its orbital path. This movement alters our view of the night sky, making different constellations visible at different times of the year."
