Model Answer: {
    "answer": "luster",
    "reasoning": "Luster is the property of a mineral that can be determined simply by looking at it, as it relates to how a mineral reflects light from its surface. This visual characteristic does not require any physical measurements or tools like scales or scratch tests, which are necessary to determine mass, weight, and hardness, respectively. Therefore, luster is the correct choice among the given options."
