Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Air",
    "reasoning": "As a tadpole grows and its gills change into lungs, it transitions from an aquatic life to a more terrestrial one. Lungs are respiratory organs designed for the exchange of gases with the air, not water. Therefore, once the transformation from gills to lungs has occurred, the tadpole, now becoming a frog or toad, requires air to survive, making 'Air' the correct answer from the given options."
