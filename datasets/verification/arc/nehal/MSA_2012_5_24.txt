Question: Most electrical wires are covered with plastic or rubber. The wires are covered with plastic or rubber because those materials
Options: ['are conductors of electricity', 'make complete electric circuits', 'are not conductors of electricity', 'make the electricity move quickly']
Answer: are not conductors of electricity

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "are not conductors of electricity",
    "reasoning": "Electrical wires are covered with plastic or rubber because both materials are insulators, not conductors of electricity. The purpose of using plastic and rubber is to prevent the escape of electric current from the wires, ensuring safety and the efficient functioning of electric circuits by keeping the electricity within the wires."
