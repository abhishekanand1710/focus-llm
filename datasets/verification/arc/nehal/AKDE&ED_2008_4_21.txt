Model Answer: {
    "answer": "air",
    "reasoning": "Among the options given, air is the only material in a gaseous state. Gases, such as air, have the property of expanding to completely fill their container regardless of the container's size. This behavior is due to the high kinetic energy of gas particles, which allows them to move freely and fill any available space. Unlike solids like ice and sand or liquids like water, air (in its gaseous state) will expand and distribute evenly throughout the entire volume of the larger container it is placed in."
