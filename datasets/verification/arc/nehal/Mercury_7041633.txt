Answer: restoration ecology

Concepts: [
    {
        "name": "hunting",
        "description": "The pursuit and killing or capturing of wildlife."
    },
    {

        "description": "The process by which natural habitat is rendered unable to support the species present."
    },
    {
        "name": "restoration ecology",
        "description": "The scientific study supporting the practice of ecological restoration, which is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed."
    },
    {
        "name": "introduced nonnative species",
        "description": "Species that are introduced to a new area where they do not naturally occur, potentially causing harm to the native species and ecosystems."
    }

        "description": "Restoration ecology aims to restore ecosystems, potentially reversing the damage done and supporting the recovery of species at risk of extinction."
    },
    {
        "concept": "introduced nonnative species",
        "relationship": "contributes to",
        "related_concept": "extinction of species",
        "description": "Nonnative species can outcompete, prey on, or bring diseases to native species, contributing to their risk of extinction."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "restoration ecology",
    "reasoning": "Unlike hunting, habitat destruction, and the introduction of nonnative species, which all contribute to the extinction of species, restoration ecology is focused on the recovery and preservation of ecosystems. It aims to reverse the damage done by these other activities, thereby supporting the conservation of species rather than contributing to their extinction."
