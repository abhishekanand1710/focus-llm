Model Answer: {
    "answer": "decreasing soil fertility",
    "reasoning": "The overproduction of corn for ethanol production leads to the depletion of nutrients in the soil, which is critical for maintaining soil fertility. This stands out as the direct negative environmental effect of corn overproduction, linking the cultivation practices to soil degradation without immediate ties to the other options, which concern broader environmental or industry-related impacts."
