    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "breaking a glass",
    "reasoning": "Breaking a glass represents a physical change because it results in a change of form or appearance without altering the substance's chemical composition. The other options represent chemical changes, where the chemical composition of the starting material changes."
