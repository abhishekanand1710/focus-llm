Question: In the carbon cycle, carbon moves from reservoir to reservoir as various organic and inorganic processes occur on Earth. Only a small percentage of the global carbon is moved in this cycle each year. The remaining carbon is stored in these reservoirs. Which reservoir contains the greatest amount of stored carbon?
Options: ['plant biomass', 'the atmosphere', 'fossil fuels', 'the deep ocean']
Answer: the deep ocean

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the deep ocean",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, the deep ocean contains the greatest amount of stored carbon. It acts as the largest reservoir in the carbon cycle, storing carbon in the form of dissolved inorganic carbon. The deep ocean surpasses other reservoirs like the atmosphere, plant biomass, and fossil fuels in terms of the volume of carbon stored."
