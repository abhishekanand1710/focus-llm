Model Answer: {
    "answer": "repeat the experiment several times.",
    "reasoning": "To make the findings more reliable, it is essential to minimize random errors and ensure consistency across measurements. Repeating the experiment several times allows for the averaging of results, reducing the impact of anomalies and increasing the reliability of the findings. Changing the size of the marbles or the height from which they are released introduces new variables, but does not inherently improve the reliability of the measurement of speed. Likewise, tilting the plane at different angles would investigate a different aspect of the phenomenon rather than improving reliability."
