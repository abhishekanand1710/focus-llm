Question: Rain forests contain more species of trees than any other biome. However, scientists have found that the soil of the forest floor is relatively nutrient poor. What could most likely account for this?
Options: ['The lack of weathering reduces the availability of the minerals.', 'The nutrients are being utilized by the plant life.', 'The forest floor does not get enough sunlight.', 'The animals eat the nutrients.']
Answer: The nutrients are being utilized by the plant life.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The nutrients are being utilized by the plant life.",
    "reasoning": "In rain forests, the high biodiversity, including a large number of plant species, leads to intense competition for nutrients. The plants rapidly absorb and utilize available nutrients from the soil for their growth, contributing to the phenomenon where the soil becomes relatively nutrient-poor. Unlike other suggested factors, the rapid uptake of nutrients by the dense plant life directly leads to the depletion of soil nutrients, making option 'The nutrients are being utilized by the plant life.' the most likely reason for nutrient-poor soils in rainforest environments."
