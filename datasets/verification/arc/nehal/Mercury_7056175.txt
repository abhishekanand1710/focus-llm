Question: A pharmaceutical company has published the results of a limited experiment investigating the protective value of a chemical compound against high doses of UV rays on skin cells. It was later discovered that the results were not reproducible. What action could the company researchers have taken to avoid publishing erroneous results?
Options: ['Perform multiple trials.', 'Use only low levels of radiation.', 'Use different wavelengths of radiation.', 'Look into results of similar experiments before forming a hypothesis.']
Answer: Perform multiple trials.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Perform multiple trials.",
    "reasoning": "Performing multiple trials is fundamental for ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of experimental results. It allows researchers to confirm that the findings are not due to chance or unknown variables. The consistency of results across various trials provides a stronger basis for the conclusions drawn. This method directly addresses the concern of avoiding the publication of erroneous results, as it aims to verify the repeatability of the experiment's outcomes. In contrast, the other options do not directly target the issue of reproducibility and verification of results."
