Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Large fins",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, 'Large fins' are the most closely associated with enhanced swimming speed and maneuverability, which are essential for a tuna to swim fast and catch its small, fast-moving prey. Large fins contribute directly to a tuna's ability to accelerate quickly and change direction while pursuing prey, making it the adaptation that most helps a tuna swim fast to catch its prey. The other options do not as directly affect a fish's swimming speed in relation to hunting."
