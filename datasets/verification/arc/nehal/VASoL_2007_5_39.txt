Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The grasshoppers are green with long back legs and antennae.",
    "reasoning": "The only option that reflects a direct observation which could be made during a nature walk is noting the physical characteristics of grasshoppers, such as being green with long back legs and antennae. This observation is about their appearance, which can be immediately noticed without requiring any analysis or experimentation."
