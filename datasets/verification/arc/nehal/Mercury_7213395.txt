Question: A student stirred some sand into a container of water and left the mixture alone for several hours until the sand settled on the bottom of the container. Which statement best explains why the sand separated from the water?
Options: ['Sand particles are denser than water.', 'Water is a liquid and sand is a solid.', 'The sand was insufficiently stirred.', 'There was more sand than water.']
Answer: Sand particles are denser than water.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Sand particles are denser than water.",
    "reasoning": "The primary reason the sand settles to the bottom of the container is due to its higher density compared to water. Density is a fundamental property that determines whether a substance will sink or float in another, and since sand has a higher density than water, it sinks to the bottom after stirring ceases, resulting in separation from the water."
