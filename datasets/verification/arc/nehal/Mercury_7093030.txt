Question: How does acid rain most likely affect forests?
Options: ['Top soil loses all of its nutrients.', 'Plants begin to grow deeper roots.', 'Animals have more food sources.', 'Trees become less healthy over time.']
Answer: Trees become less healthy over time.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Trees become less healthy over time.",
    "reasoning": "Acid rain directly impacts the overall health of forests by deteriorating the quality of soil nutrients, which are essential for trees' growth and survival. This leads to less healthy trees over time due to reduced nutrient uptake from the soil, coupled with direct damage to the trees' leaves which impairs their ability to photosynthesize. Consequently, the most likely effect of acid rain on forests is that trees become less healthy over time."
