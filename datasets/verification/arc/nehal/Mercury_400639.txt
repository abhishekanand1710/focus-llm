Model Answer: {
    "answer": "all short plants",
    "reasoning": "Since tall plants are dominant and short plants are recessive, two short plants can only pass on the recessive trait for being short. Given both parents must contribute the recessive trait for it to appear in the offspring, crossing two short plants (which can only contribute the recessive trait for height) will result in all offspring being short."
