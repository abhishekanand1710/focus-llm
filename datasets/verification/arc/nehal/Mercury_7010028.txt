Options: ['is contracting.', 'has no beginning.', 'started as a single mass.', 'is constantly forming hydrogen.']
Answer: started as a single mass.

        "name": "Universe contraction",
        "description": "A hypothetical scenario where the universe's expansion halts and it begins to collapse in on itself."
    },

        "name": "Universe's beginning",
        "description": "The point in time at which the universe is considered to have started, marked by the Big Bang according to the prevalent theory."

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "started as a single mass.",
    "reasoning": "The Big Bang theory posits that the universe originated from a highly dense and hot point (single mass) and has been expanding ever since. This expansion is a fundamental aspect of the theory, which explains the initial state of the universe as a singular entity, leading to the formation of all matter, including hydrogen, as part of the aftermath of the Big Bang. Hence, the option 'started as a single mass.' directly aligns with the core premise of the Big Bang theory."
