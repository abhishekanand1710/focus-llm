Question: What do earthquakes tell scientists about the history of the planet?
Options: ['Earthâ€™s climate is constantly changing.', 'The continents of Earth are continually moving.', 'Dinosaurs became extinct about 65 million years ago.', 'The oceans are much deeper today than millions years ago.']
Answer: The continents of Earth are continually moving.

        "description": "The movement of continents over geological time changes the structure and position of landmasses on Earth."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The continents of Earth are continually moving.",
    "reasoning": "Earthquakes provide critical data which supports the theory of plate tectonics. This theory, in turn, explains the mechanism behind continental drift, indicating that the continents of Earth are continually moving. This is the most direct connection between what earthquakes reveal about Earth's history and the options provided."
