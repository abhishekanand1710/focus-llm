]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "electrons",
    "reasoning": "Despite their minuscule mass, electrons occupy the majority of the volume of an atom, as they are located in orbits around the nucleus, which itself is very dense but occupies only a tiny fraction of the atom's volume. The space within which electrons move defines the overall size of the atom."
