Question: An engineer measured the time it takes sound to travel through samples of different materials. All of the samples were identical in shape and size. The measurements were made using ultrasonic waves with a frequency of 5 megahertz. Which question was the engineer most likely trying to answer?
Options: ['In which material does sound travel fastest?', 'In which material does sound travel farthest?', 'Does frequency affect the distance sound travels?', 'Does the shape of the medium affect the speed of sound?']
Answer: In which material does sound travel fastest?

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "In which material does sound travel fastest?",
    "reasoning": "Given that ultrasonic waves of a fixed frequency were used to measure the time it takes for sound to travel through samples of different materials, all identical in shape and size, the engineer's investigation focuses on how the material type affects sound speed. The experiment design\u2014employing a constant shape, size, and sound frequency\u2014aims to isolate the material as the variable of interest. This indicates the engineer sought to compare how fast sound travels through various materials, aiming to determine which material allows for the quickest sound propagation."
