Model Answer: {
    "answer": "1 liter of water at a temperature of 75\u00b0C",
    "reasoning": "The average kinetic energy of molecules in a substance increases with temperature. Among the options provided, '1 liter of water at a temperature of 75\u00b0C' has the highest temperature and is in a liquid state, meaning its molecules have greater freedom to move compared to those in a solid state (ice). Therefore, this sample has the greatest average kinetic energy per molecule."
