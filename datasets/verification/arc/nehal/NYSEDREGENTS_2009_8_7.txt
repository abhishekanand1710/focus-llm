Model Answer: {
    "answer": "chemical -> electrical -> light",
    "reasoning": "Initially, the battery in the flashlight stores energy in chemical form. Once the flashlight is turned on, this chemical energy is converted into electrical energy, which then flows through the flashlight's components. Finally, the flashlight's bulb or LED converts this electrical energy into light energy, illuminating the surroundings."
