Model Answer: {
    "answer": "black",
    "reasoning": "When blue light is shone on a yellow banana, the banana appears black. This is because the yellow banana reflects yellow light under normal conditions. When illuminated by blue light, which does not contain yellow wavelengths, the banana cannot reflect the blue light since it is designed to reflect yellow light. Thus, it absorbs the blue light, and none (or very little) of the light is reflected back to the observer. Since no light is being reflected, the banana appears black."
