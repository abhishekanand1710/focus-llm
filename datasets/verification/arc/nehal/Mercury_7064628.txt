Model Answer: {
    "answer": "solar radiation",
    "reasoning": "The primary source of energy that causes evaporation of water from the surface of bodies of water is solar radiation. This is because solar radiation directly provides the energy needed to increase the kinetic energy of water molecules, leading to their transition from liquid to vapor, which is the essence of evaporation. While transpiration by plants, heat from nearby land masses, and convection currents in the water all play roles in the water cycle and can influence evaporation, they do not serve as the primary source of energy for the evaporation process in the same direct and widespread manner as solar radiation does."
