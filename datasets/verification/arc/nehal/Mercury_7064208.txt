Model Answer: {
    "answer": "promotes good dental hygiene.",
    "reasoning": "Given that the toothpaste is advertised to have a higher concentration of fluoride than any other available, and considering the role of fluoride in strengthening tooth enamel and preventing decay, it can be inferred that the toothpaste promotes good dental hygiene. This inference is based on the established relationships between fluoride's ability to support dental health, its inclusion in toothpaste for that purpose, and the importance of dental hygiene as recommended by dental professionals."
