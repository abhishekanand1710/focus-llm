Model Answer: {
    "answer": "loss of electrons.",
    "reasoning": "Metal atoms are known to lose electrons in order to achieve a stable electron configuration, which results in the formation of positive ions. This process, referred to as the loss of electrons, aligns with the fundamental properties of metals and their typical reaction patterns. Unlike losing protons, which would alter the atom's identity, or gaining protons or electrons, which are less common for metals, losing electrons to form cations (positive ions) is the most relevant and common process for metal atoms during ionization."
