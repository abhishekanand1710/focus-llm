Question: The weight of an object can change even when the mass stays the same. Which statement correctly identifies a relationship between mass and weight?
Options: ['The weight of an object depends on its mass and its volume.', 'Gravity affects the weight of an object but not its mass.', 'The mass of an object depends on its weight and size.', 'Magnetic fields can affect mass but not weight.']
Answer: Gravity affects the weight of an object but not its mass.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Gravity affects the weight of an object but not its mass.",
    "reasoning": "The correct relationship between mass and weight is that weight changes with the gravitational pull acting on the mass of the object. Gravity directly affects the weight of an object without changing its mass; hence, an object's weight can change (e.g., on the moon vs. on Earth) while its mass stays the same. The other options are incorrect because they either misstate the relationship between weight, mass, volume, or imply an effect of magnetic fields on mass, which is not accurate."
