Model Answer: {
    "answer": "protection.",
    "reasoning": "The primary function of scales covering the body of a fish is to provide protection. This is achieved through the scales' ability to act as a physical barrier against environmental hazards and predators. While scales may also contribute to a fish's coloration and could be considered decorative in a broad sense, their fundamental evolutionary purpose is protection. Other options like decoration, coloration, and reproduction are secondary or indirect roles not directly fulfilled by the scales themselves."
