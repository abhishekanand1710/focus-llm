Model Answer: {
    "answer": [
        "steel cans",
        "glass bottles"
    ],
    "reasoning": "Steel cans and glass bottles can be recycled many times without significant loss in quality or purity, making them suitable to be reused many times. On the other hand, paper containers and plastic containers degrade in quality after each recycling round, thus limiting the number of times they can be reused effectively."
