Question: An escalator at a shopping mall is 10 m long and moves at a constant speed of 0.5 m/s. If Jose steps onto the escalator at the bottom while it is moving, how long will it take him to travel the 10 m?
Options: ['5 s', '10 s', '15 s', '20 s']
Answer: 20 s

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "20 s",
    "reasoning": "Since the escalator is 10 m long and moves at a constant speed of 0.5 m/s, the time it takes to travel the 10 m can be calculated by dividing the distance by the speed (Time = Distance / Speed). Here, Time = 10 m / 0.5 m/s = 20 seconds. Thus, based on the relationships between length, speed, and time, it would take 20 seconds to travel the 10 m on the escalator."
