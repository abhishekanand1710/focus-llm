Question: Coal is solid rock that began as organic material that was deposited in a swamp. The formation of coal suggests that
Options: ['coal is made mostly of skeletal remains of animals.', 'coal is formed from magma that has solidified over time.', 'it quickly becomes petrified when water is removed.', 'geologic processes continue over millions of years.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "geologic processes continue over millions of years.",
    "reasoning": "Coal originates from organic material that was deposited in swamps. Over millions of years, geologic processes such as sedimentation, burial, and compression transform this organic material into coal. This conclusion is supported by the relationships between coal, organic materials, geologic processes, and the environment in which the initial organic matter is deposited (swamps). Unlike coal formation, petrification, the solidification of magma, and the composition of skeletal remains do not directly contribute to the process of coal formation."
