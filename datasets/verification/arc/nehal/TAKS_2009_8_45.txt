]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "consume liquids",
    "reasoning": "During exercise, the body loses fluids through sweat, leading to the sensation of thirst. Thirst is a signal from the body indicating the need for hydration. Consuming liquids is the direct response to this need, helping to rehydrate the body and support its physiological functions during and after physical activity. The relationships identified between exercise, thirst, sweat, and the consumption of liquids clearly support the importance of drinking fluids in response to thirst while exercising."
