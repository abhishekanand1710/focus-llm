Model Answer: {
    "answer": "hydrogen",
    "reasoning": "In the context of stars such as the Sun, hydrogen is known to be the most abundant element. Stars are primarily made of plasma, a state of matter consisting of free electrons and atomic nuclei, and in stars like the Sun, hydrogen is fused to form helium in a process that releases energy. Therefore, considering the concepts and relationships identified, hydrogen is the most common element in a star such as the Sun."
