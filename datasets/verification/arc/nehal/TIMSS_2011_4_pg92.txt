Question: Some animals are very rare. For example, there are very few Siberian tigers. If the only Siberian tigers left are female, what will most likely happen?
Options: ['The females will find another type of male animal to mate with and produce more Siberian tigers.', 'The females will mate with each other and produce more Siberian tigers.', 'The females will only be able to produce female Siberian tigers.', 'The females will not be able to produce more Siberian tigers, and they will die out.']
Answer: The females will not be able to produce more Siberian tigers, and they will die out.

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The females will not be able to produce more Siberian tigers, and they will die out.",
    "reasoning": "Given the fundamental requirement for both male and female individuals for animal reproduction, a female-only population of Siberian tigers cannot sustain its species. Interspecies breeding, although an alternative reproductive method, is largely unsuccessful in producing fertile offspring and may not result in viable Siberian tiger offspring due to genetic and species incompatibilities. Hence, without the ability to reproduce successfully, the species will likely face extinction."
