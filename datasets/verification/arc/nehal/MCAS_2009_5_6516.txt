    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The refrigerator door contains iron.",
    "reasoning": "Magnets stick to a refrigerator door primarily because the door contains iron, a metal that magnets attract due to their magnetic field. The smoothness of the door, its electrical conductivity, and the presence of electric wires in the refrigerator do not directly influence the magnetic attraction."
