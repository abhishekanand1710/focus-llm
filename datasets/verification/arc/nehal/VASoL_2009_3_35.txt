Model Answer: {
    "answer": "everyday materials can be reused",
    "reasoning": "The examples of an old T-shirt being repurposed into rags and an empty milk jug being used to water houseplants both illustrate the concept of reuse. This approach supports conservation by preventing wasteful use of resources and exemplifies how everyday materials can be adapted for new uses, therefore fitting the option that everyday materials can be reused."
