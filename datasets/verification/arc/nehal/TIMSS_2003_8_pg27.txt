Question: The burning of fossil fuels has increased the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere. What is a possible effect that the increased amount of carbon dioxide is likely to have on our planet?
Options: ['A warmer climate', 'A cooler climate', 'Lower relative humidity', 'More ozone in the atmosphere']
Answer: A warmer climate

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "A warmer climate",
    "reasoning": "The burning of fossil fuels increases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a key greenhouse gas. This leads to the greenhouse effect, which traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, ultimately contributing to global warming and a consequent rise in global temperatures, resulting in a warmer climate."
