Question: Which statement best compares single-celled and multi-celled organisms?
Options: ['Tissues in a single-celled organism are like the cells in a multi-celled organism.', 'The nucleus in a single-celled organism is like the skin of a multi-celled organism.', 'Organelles in a single-celled organism are like the organs in a multi-celled organism.', 'The cytoplasm in a single-celled organism is like the nervous system in a multi-celled organism.']
Answer: Organelles in a single-celled organism are like the organs in a multi-celled organism.

        "related_concept": "Organs",
        "description": "Organelles in single-celled organisms perform functions similar to organs in multi-celled organisms."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Organelles in a single-celled organism are like the organs in a multi-celled organism.",
    "reasoning": "This comparison is appropriate because both organelles in single-celled organisms and organs in multi-celled organisms perform specific functions vital for the life of the organism. Organelles are to single-celled organisms what organs are to multi-celled organisms in terms of functional specialization and necessity for survival."
