Question: Which land form is the result of the constructive force of a glacier?
Options: ['valleys carved by a moving glacier', 'piles of rocks deposited by a melting glacier', 'grooves created in a granite surface by a glacier', 'bedrock hills roughened by the passing of a glacier']
Answer: piles of rocks deposited by a melting glacier

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "piles of rocks deposited by a melting glacier",
    "reasoning": "The question asks for the result of the constructive force of a glacier, which implies a process that builds up or adds to the landscape. Among the given options, 'piles of rocks deposited by a melting glacier' best fits the description of a constructive process, as it involves the deposition of material (in this case, rocks and debris) by glaciers, creating new landforms such as moraines. The other options describe erosive or modifying actions by the glacier, which are not constructive in nature."
