Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a site deep underground",
    "reasoning": "Metamorphic rocks such as gneiss and schist form under conditions of intense heat and pressure, which are most likely to be found deep underground. This environment facilitates the transformation of original rock into metamorphic rock. In contrast, sea floors, windblown deserts, and sites covered by glaciers do not typically provide the necessary conditions of heat and pressure for the formation of metamorphic rocks like gneiss and schist."
