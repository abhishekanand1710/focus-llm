Question: Cells are the basic unit of structure and function in all living organisms. Which describes the greatest difference between the cells of a baby gorilla and the cells of an adult gorilla?
Options: ['The adult has more cells than the baby.', 'The baby has simpler cells than an adult.', 'The baby has smaller cells than the adult.', 'The adult has different types of cells than the baby.']
Answer: The adult has more cells than the baby.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The adult has more cells than the baby.",
    "reasoning": "The main distinction between the cells of a baby gorilla and an adult gorilla lies in the number of cells. Both baby and adult gorillas are made up of cells that share the same level of complexity, the cells are similarly complex across different life stages. The size of the cells does not inherently differ significantly between a baby and an adult gorilla, and while the types of cells needed for various functions are already present in early developmental stages, the number of cells increases as a baby gorilla grows into an adult. This increase in cell number is a direct result of the growth and developmental processes that a baby gorilla undergoes to become an adult."
