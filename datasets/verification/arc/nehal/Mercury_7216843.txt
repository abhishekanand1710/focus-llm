Question: Water enters a cell and waste material leaves a cell through the cell membrane. Based on this information, the cell membrane is
Options: ['semi-permeable.', 'transparent.', 'rigid.', 'impermeable.']
Answer: semi-permeable.

        "description": "A molecule (H2O) essential for all known forms of life."
    },
    {

        "description": "Substances expelled from living organisms that are no longer needed or toxic."
    },

        "description": "Allowing light to pass through so that objects behind can be distinctly seen."
    },

        "name": "Rigid",
        "description": "Unable to bend or be forced out of shape."
    },
    {

        "description": "Being semi-permeable enables the cell membrane to allow selective substances to pass through it."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "semi-permeable.",
    "reasoning": "The ability for water to enter a cell and for waste material to exit a cell through the cell membrane indicates the membrane's selective permeability. Among the options, only 'semi-permeable' accurately describes a membrane that allows certain substances to pass while blocking others, matching the functionality of the cell membrane as described."
