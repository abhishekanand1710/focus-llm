Question: When a finger is cut and bleeds, platelets and plasma proteins move to the cut to stop the bleeding. As these move to the cut, this stimulates more platelets and proteins to move to the cut to stop the bleeding. What type of mechanism is being illustrated?
Options: ['negative feedback', 'positive feedback', 'regulatory feedback', 'stimulation feedback']
Answer: positive feedback

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "positive feedback",
    "reasoning": "The mechanism of platelets and plasma proteins moving to the cut and stimulating more platelets and proteins to move to the cut to stop the bleeding represents a positive feedback loop, where the initial response enhances further similar responses, thus amplifying the effect."
