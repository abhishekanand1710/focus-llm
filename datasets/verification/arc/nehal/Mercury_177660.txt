Model Answer: {
    "answer": "['Uranium - Lead', 'Rubidium - Strontium', 'Potassium - Argon']",
    "reasoning": "The question asks for two isotopes involved in calculating radioactive decay to determine the relative age of rocks. 'Uranium-Lead', 'Rubidium-Strontium', and 'Potassium-Argon' are all valid pairs of isotopes used in different radiometric dating methods to estimate the ages of rocks through the process of radioactive decay. These methods are scientifically established and widely used in geology for dating. 'Uranium-Strontium' is not a commonly recognized pair for standard radiometric dating, hence it is not included in the correct answers."
