Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Steam can transfer heat to cooler objects.",
    "reasoning": "Steam is capable of transferring heat to objects that are cooler than itself, which is the principle behind using steam to cook food. The heat from the steam is transferred to the food, causing it to cook. This is supported by the relationship between steam being able to transfer its heat to cooler objects, and heat transfer being an essential element in the cooking process."
