Question: Photosynthesis is a process involving carbon dioxide, water, glucose, oxygen, and sunlight. Which is the correct chemical equation for photosynthesis?
Options: ['O_{2} + H_{2}O + energy -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + CO_{2}', 'CO_{2} + H_{2}O -> C_{6}H_{6}O_{3} + O_{2} + energy', '6O_{2} + 6H_{2}O -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6CO_{2} + energy', '6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2}']
Answer: 6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2}

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "'6CO_{2} + 6H_{2}O + energy -> C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + 6O_{2}'",
    "reasoning": "This option correctly represents the process of photosynthesis where six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) combine with six molecules of water (H2O) in the presence of sunlight to produce one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) and six molecules of oxygen (O2). This aligns with the established scientific knowledge and relationships among the concepts, as photosynthesis transforms CO2 and H2O into glucose and O2 using the energy from sunlight."
