Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The components retain their original properties.",
    "reasoning": "The snack described is a mixture because its components, such as peanuts, sunflower seeds, raisins, almonds, and chocolate pieces, retain their original physical properties even when combined. This means each ingredient remains distinct and does not chemically combine with the others, which is a key characteristic of mixtures."
}
