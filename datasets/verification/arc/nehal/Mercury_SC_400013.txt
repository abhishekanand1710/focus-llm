Model Answer: {
    "answer": "speckled brown coloring that looks like leaves",
    "reasoning": "The speckled brown coloring of some young birds serves as camouflage, effectively blending them into their surroundings and making it harder for predators to spot them. This coloration acts as a crucial survival tactic before the birds are capable of flight, unlike the other options which either do not provide a defensive advantage or pertain to stages of development and feeding adaptations not directly related to avoiding predation."
