Question: Several horses grazed in a fenced area across from a home. On rainy days, soil would wash down a slope and run toward the home. After the horses were moved a few years later, the soil no longer washed down when it rained. What could account for this change?
Options: ['The grass grew and kept the soil intact.', 'The fence kept the soil contained.', 'The soil was completely gone.', 'The amount of rain decreased.']
Answer: The grass grew and kept the soil intact.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The grass grew and kept the soil intact.",
    "reasoning": "Once the horses were removed from the area, they no longer prevented the grass from growing. The established grass then helped to hold the soil in place, reducing or eliminating the erosion that had previously caused soil to wash down the slope when it rained. Therefore, the regrowth of grass after the removal of the grazing pressure from the horses directly contributed to the stabilization of the soil and prevented it from washing away during rainfalls."
