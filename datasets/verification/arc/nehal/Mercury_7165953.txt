Question: A geologist conducts an investigation to determine the absolute age of a fossil. She then repeats the procedure three times. Which best explains why she repeated the procedure several times?
Options: ['It helps her develop better procedures.', 'It improves the accuracy of the results.', 'She wants all the results to be different.', 'She has more than one hypothesis to prove.']
Answer: It improves the accuracy of the results.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It improves the accuracy of the results.",
    "reasoning": "Repeating the procedure several times allows the geologist to verify the results, ensuring the measurements are consistent and thereby improving the overall accuracy of the absolute age determination of the fossil. This is a common practice in scientific research to minimize errors and ensure reliability of the findings."
