    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "parents",
    "reasoning": "The eye color of a young eagle, like in many other animals, is primarily determined by genetics, which are directly contributed by the parents. While factors such as diet and behavior can have effects on the physical development of an eagle, the foundational aspect of eye color is genetic, thus making the parents the greatest factor influencing the color of a young eagle's eyes. The other options, nest and behavior, play roles in the eagle's development but do not directly influence eye color to the extent that genetics do."
