Question: Students studying membranes conducted an experiment using labeled paper cups filled with varying concentrations of red food coloring. After the experiment, the cups were empty and stained. What should be done with used cups?
Options: ['reuse the cups', 'dispose of the cups', 'recycle the cups', 'relabel the cups']
Answer: recycle the cups

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "recycle the cups",
    "reasoning": "Given that the cups are made from paper, which is recyclable, recycling them would be the most environmentally responsible action. Although they are stained with food coloring, this does not necessarily prevent recycling. This option aligns with sustainability practices, converting waste into reusable material, unlike disposing which removes the possibility of reuse or repurposing."
