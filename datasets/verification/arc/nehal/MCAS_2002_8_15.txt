Options: ['worms', 'fungi', 'plant roots', 'microorganisms']
Answer: plant roots

        "relationship": "do not participate in",
        "related_concept": "decomposition",
        "description": "Plant roots absorb water and nutrients but are not directly involved in the breakdown and decay of dead material."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "plant roots",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, plant roots are the least involved in the decomposition and decay of dead plants and animals. While worms, fungi, and microorganisms all play a direct role in the decomposition process by consuming, breaking down, or aiding in the breakdown of dead organic material, plant roots are primarily involved in water and nutrient absorption for the living plant and do not participate in the decomposition of dead matter."
