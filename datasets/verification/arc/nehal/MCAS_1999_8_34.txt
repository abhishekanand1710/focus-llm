Model Answer: {
    "answer": "June 30",
    "reasoning": "Given that a lunar cycle lasts approximately 29.5 days and a new moon occurred on June 2, the next new moon would occur approximately 29.5 days later. Looking at the options provided and considering the length of a lunar cycle, June 30 is the closest date that aligns with the ~29.5 days cycle from June 2, making it the most accurate prediction for the next new moon."
