Question: What adaptation is necessary in intertidal ecosystems but not in reef ecosystems?
Options: ['the ability to live in salt water', 'the ability to use oxygen in respiration', 'the ability to cope with daily dry periods', 'the ability to blend into the surroundings']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the ability to cope with daily dry periods",
    "reasoning": "The key adaptation necessary in intertidal ecosystems but not in reef ecosystems is the ability to cope with daily dry periods. This is because intertidal zones are uniquely characterized by their exposure to the air at low tides and being submerged at high tides, requiring organisms to have adaptations to survive without water for parts of the day. Reef ecosystems are always submerged and do not experience this fluctuation, making such an adaptation unnecessary."
