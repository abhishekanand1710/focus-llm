    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "argon",
    "reasoning": "Among the options given, argon is the least electrically conductive because it is a noble gas characterized by its lack of reactivity and inability to easily form ions or conduct electricity. In contrast, sodium, tungsten, and zinc are metals known for their ability to conduct electricity."
