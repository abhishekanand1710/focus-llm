    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "from its parents",
    "reasoning": "A tiger's stripes are a genetic trait inherited from its parents. The stripes are coded in the tiger's DNA, which is passed from parents to their offspring. This makes 'from its parents' the correct answer as neither the environment, food, nor the offspring itself initiates the presence of stripes; instead, they are a result of genetic inheritance."
