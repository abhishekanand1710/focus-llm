Model Answer: {
    "answer": "collect relevant evidence",
    "reasoning": "Before making a valid conclusion, scientists must collect relevant evidence. This is because a valid conclusion is based on empirical evidence and reasoning directly related to the hypothesis or questions posed by the investigation. Collecting relevant evidence is a prerequisite for drawing any conclusions from the investigation, as it directly supports or refutes the initial hypothesis. The other options, while part of the scientific process, are actions that typically occur after the relevant evidence has been collected and analyzed."
