Model Answer: {
    "answer": "more likely to be correct due to fewer errors being made.",
    "reasoning": "Repeating experiments is a method that increases the reliability of the experiment outcomes by reducing the impact of random errors. As the experiments are performed multiple times, the aggregate results help mitigate any anomalous data or observations, leading to a more accurate reflection of the true results. This process does not inherently increase the likelihood to prove or disprove a hypothesis directly, but instead enhances the accuracy of the results by minimizing the impact of errors."
