Options: ['begin as eggs.', 'require the same amount of time.', 'have beginning, growing, and mature stages.', 'resemble their parents from the beginning stages.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "have beginning, growing, and mature stages.",
    "reasoning": "Both plant and animal life cycles share the commonality of having beginning, growing, and mature stages. This is a fundamental aspect of their development, irrespective of the differences in their specific life processes or reproductive mechanisms. While not all organisms begin life as eggs (making the 'begin as eggs' option incorrect for plants), and the amount of time required for their development and the degree of resemblance to their parents from the beginning can vary greatly, the presence of distinct growth stages is a universal feature of both plant and animal life cycles."
