Question: Hatchling sea turtles are typically dark in color. Occasionally, a sea turtle hatches that is almost white in color. When crawling from the nest on the beach to the ocean, this light-colored sea turtle could be at risk for sunburn. The light color of the turtles would most likely
Options: ['help the turtles have better chances at reproducing.', 'cause the shell of the sea turtles to become stronger.', 'reduce the chances of turtles surviving to reproduce.', 'help in the development of a new species of sea turtles.']
Answer: reduce the chances of turtles surviving to reproduce.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "reduce the chances of turtles surviving to reproduce.",
    "reasoning": "The light-colored sea turtles are at a disadvantage due to their lack of camouflage, which makes them more visible to predators (increasing predation risk) and potentially more susceptible to sunburn due to their reduced pigmentation. Both of these factors contribute to a reduced likelihood of surviving to an age where they can reproduce, thereby impacting their overall chances of contributing to the gene pool of their species."
