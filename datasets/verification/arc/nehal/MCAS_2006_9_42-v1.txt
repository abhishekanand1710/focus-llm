    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Both processes involve energy transformations.",
    "reasoning": "Both photosynthesis and cellular respiration are processes that involve the transformation of energy. Photosynthesis converts solar energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, while cellular respiration converts the chemical energy in glucose into ATP, a form of energy usable by cells. This makes energy transformation a fundamental characteristic shared between the two processes, unlike the other options which are either unique to one process or incorrectly associated with both."
