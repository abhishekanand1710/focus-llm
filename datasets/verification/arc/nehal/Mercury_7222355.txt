Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Blue has a higher frequency than green.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the inverse relationship between wavelength and frequency, as well as the order of colors in the visible spectrum from violet to red, blue light has a shorter wavelength and hence a higher frequency than green. This is corroborated by the established fact that as you move from violet to red in the spectrum, the wavelength increases while the frequency decreases."
