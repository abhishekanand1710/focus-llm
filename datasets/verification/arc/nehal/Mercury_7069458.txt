Model Answer: {
    "answer": "doubling the distance between them and halving their mass",
    "reasoning": "According to the inverse square law, doubling the distance between two objects reduces the gravitational force between them by a factor of four. Halving the mass of both objects further reduces the gravitational force by half. This combination of increasing the distance and reducing the mass will result in the greatest reduction of the gravitational force between the two objects compared to the other options."
