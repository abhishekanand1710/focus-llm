Question: A student is organizing a room. She moves a box from the floor to a shelf. She wants to estimate the amount of potential energy the box has on the shelf. What information does the student need?
Options: ['the volume and mass of the box', 'the mass of the shelf and the mass of the box', 'the mass of the box and the height of the shelf', 'the volume of the box and the height of the shelf']
Answer: the mass of the box and the height of the shelf

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the mass of the box and the height of the shelf",
    "reasoning": "To estimate the potential energy of the box on the shelf, information about the mass of the box and the height of the shelf from a reference point is needed. Potential energy is calculated using the formula Ep = mgh, where 'm' is the mass of the object, 'g' is the gravitational acceleration, and 'h' is the height above the reference point. Therefore, volume of the box and the mass of the shelf are not necessary for this calculation."
