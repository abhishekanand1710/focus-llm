Question: A student uses clay to build models of an ocean plate and a continental plate. What characteristic cannot be accurately represented by the models?
Options: ['the shapes of plates', 'the relative sizes of plates', 'the relative densities of plates', 'the arrangement of plates relative to one another']
Answer: the relative densities of plates

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the relative densities of plates",
    "reasoning": "While clay models can effectively represent the shapes, relative sizes, and arrangement of tectonic plates, they cannot accurately depict the relative densities of the plates. This is because clay has a uniform density, which does not vary to reflect the differences between the densities of oceanic and continental plates."
