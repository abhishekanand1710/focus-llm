Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The Sun makes heat.",
    "reasoning": "The Sun emits sunlight, which consists of light and heat. When an ice cube is placed in sunlight, it absorbs the heat from the sunlight. This increase in temperature leads to the melting of the ice cube as the heat causes the ice to change from a solid state to a liquid state. Thus, the process of the ice cube melting quickly in sunlight is best explained by the fact that the Sun makes heat."
