Question: Joann is testing soils to see which kind is best for growing marigolds. Which of the following should she do?
Options: ['Plant the marigolds in the same soil, but water some plants more than others.', 'Plant the marigolds in one kind of soil, radishes in another, and daisies in a third kind.', 'Plant the marigolds three kinds of soil, and give them different amounts of sun.', 'Plant the marigolds in three kinds of soil, and give them the same amounts of water and sun.']
Answer: Plant the marigolds in three kinds of soil, and give them the same amounts of water and sun.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Plant the marigolds in three kinds of soil, and give them the same amounts of water and sun.",
    "reasoning": "To test which soil type is best for growing marigolds effectively, it's crucial to change only the type of soil while keeping other variables like watering and sunlight consistent. This approach aligns with the principles of a controlled experiment, which aims to isolate the effect of a single variable (in this case, soil type) on an outcome (marigold growth). Planting marigolds in three kinds of soil under identical water and sun conditions allows for a fair comparison of how well each soil supports marigold growth."
