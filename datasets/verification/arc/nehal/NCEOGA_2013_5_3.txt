Question: A girl walked for 30 minutes. She noticed that she traveled farther in the first 15 minutes of her walk than in the second 15 minutes. What can she conclude about her walk?
Options: ['She walked over many hills.', 'Her average speed was faster during the first half of her walk.', 'She walked in two different directions.', 'She was walking at a constant speed.']
Answer: Her average speed was faster during the first half of her walk.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Her average speed was faster during the first half of her walk.",
    "reasoning": "Given that the girl traveled farther in the first 15 minutes than in the second 15 minutes, we can conclude that her speed during the first half of the walk was higher than during the second half. This is because, for the same amount of time, the distance covered is directly proportional to the speed, indicating that her average speed during the first half was faster."
