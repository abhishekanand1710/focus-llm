Model Answer: {
    "answer": "solar",
    "reasoning": "Considering Las Vegas's location in a desert region, solar energy is the most feasible renewable resource available that can generate electricity without degrading the environment. Las Vegas receives ample sunlight, making solar power a suitable and environmentally friendly option. Unlike petroleum and nuclear options, solar power does not consume finite resources or produce waste. Geothermal is also renewable, but the question's context highlights an option that leverages Las Vegas's specific environmental conditions, thus indicating solar as the optimal choice."
