Question: A person catches and measures a large fish called a halibut. She thinks that this halibut is above average in size. To help support her thinking, it would be most helpful to measure
Options: ['many types of fish.', 'many fish of the same type.', 'fish from the same location.', 'fish during a different season.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "many fish of the same type.",
    "reasoning": "To support her thinking that the halibut she caught is above average in size, it is most useful to measure many fish of the same type (halibut). This approach directly contributes to understanding the average size of halibut by providing a comparison group identical in species. Measuring different types of fish or fish from different locations or seasons would introduce variables that could skew the perception of what is average for a halibut specifically."
