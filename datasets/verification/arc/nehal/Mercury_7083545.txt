    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "evaluating and interpreting data",
    "reasoning": "Evalauting and interpreting data is the most critical step in reaching a conclusion in an investigation as it directly influences the accuracy of the derived conclusion by assessing the information or data collected during the investigation. It is supported by organizing methods and developing hypotheses, and it is a precursor to accurately predicting the most likely outcome."
