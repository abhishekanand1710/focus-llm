Model Answer: {
    "answer": "sound and heat",
    "reasoning": "Rubbing sandpaper on wood creates friction between the surfaces, which generates heat as a byproduct. At the same time, the physical action of rubbing causes the mechanical vibrations of the objects, producing sound. Light and electricity are not usually direct products of this process, making 'sound and heat' the correct answer."
