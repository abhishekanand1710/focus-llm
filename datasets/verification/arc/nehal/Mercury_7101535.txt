    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the genes of the egg",
    "reasoning": "The genes within an egg carry the inherent information necessary for determining the species of the resulting organism, such as a toad, snake, or lizard. These genetic instructions guide the developmental processes that result in the specific physical and physiological traits characteristic of each species. The other options, such as the sex, age, or size of the egg, might influence traits within a species or the development stage but do not determine the species itself."
