Question: Two layers of sedimentary rock are exposed on the side of a hill. Only one of the layers has fossils. The lack of fossils in one layer of sedimentary rock is most likely due to
Options: ['changing environments.', 'volcanic activity.', 'changing rates of erosion.', 'evaporation of sea water.']

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "changing environments",
    "reasoning": "The presence or absence of fossils in sedimentary rock layers is most directly influenced by the environmental conditions at the time the rocks were formed. Fossils require specific conditions to form and be preserved, such as rapid burial and low oxygen to prevent decay. Changing environments can lead to some periods favorable for fossilization and others not, explaining why one layer contains fossils and another does not, without invoking direct physical modifications like those caused by volcanic activity, erosion, or the process of evaporation."
