Options: ['respiratory and circulatory', 'digestive and respiratory', 'digestive and urinary', 'urinary and circulatory']
Answer: urinary and circulatory

    {
        "name": "respiratory system",
        "description": "A series of organs responsible for taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide."
    },
    {
        "name": "digestive system",
        "description": "The system by which ingested food is acted upon by physical and chemical means to provide the body with absorbable nutrients and to excrete waste products."

        "description": "The circulatory system transports blood to the kidneys for filtration."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "urinary and circulatory",
    "reasoning": "The kidneys, which are part of the urinary system, filter waste and water from the blood, a process that is directly connected to the circulatory system. This system delivers the blood to the kidneys to be filtered, which establishes a direct relationship between the urinary and circulatory systems in the context of removing waste and water from the blood."
