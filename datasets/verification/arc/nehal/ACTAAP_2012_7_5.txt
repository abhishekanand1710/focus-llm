Question: One evening as it is getting dark, Alex sits on the front porch and watches the sun slowly disappear behind the neighbor's house across the street. Which explains this observation?
Options: ["The sun's light is reflected by the clouds.", "The sun's light is refracted by the atmosphere.", 'The sun moves from west to east each day.', "The sun appears to move due to Earth's rotation."]
Answer: The sun appears to move due to Earth's rotation.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The sun appears to move due to Earth's rotation.",
    "reasoning": "The observation of the sun disappearing behind the neighbor's house as it gets dark is best explained by the Earth's rotation. This rotation causes the perceived motion of the sun across the sky, leading to sunset when the sun appears to move below the horizon from the observer's standpoint. While light refraction affects the appearance slightly, and light reflection can affect the sky's color, these do not explain the sun's movement. The sun's actual motion through space is unrelated to its daily apparent movement across the sky."
