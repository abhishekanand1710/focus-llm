Question: Constructive forces build a new mountain range. How will weathering and erosion change the features of the mountain range over time?
Options: ['layering the rocks', 'crystallizing the rocks', 'folding the layers of the rocks', 'rounding the shapes of the rocks']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "rounding the shapes of the rocks",
    "reasoning": "Over time, weathering and erosion break down the materials that make up mountain ranges. Weathering physically and chemically breaks down the rocks, while erosion transports these materials away. This process naturally leads to the rounding of the shapes of the rocks in the mountain range, as the sharp edges are worn down and smoothed over time. Therefore, 'rounding the shapes of the rocks' is the correct answer based on the described effects of weathering and erosion on mountain ranges."
