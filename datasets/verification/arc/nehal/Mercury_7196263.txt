Question: Stars generate large amounts of energy when nuclei with small mass undergo fusion to form nuclei with larger mass. Which of the four basic forces of the universe is responsible for the energy released during fusion?
Options: ['weak force', 'strong force', 'gravitational force', 'electromagnetic force']
Answer: strong force

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "strong force",
    "reasoning": "The strong force is responsible for holding the nucleus of an atom together and is the key force in the process of nuclear fusion, where nuclei with small mass combine to form larger nuclei, releasing energy. It is this fundamental force that enables the fusion process in stars, leading to the production of vast amounts of energy."
