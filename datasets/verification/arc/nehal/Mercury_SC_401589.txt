Model Answer: {
    "answer": "fruit salad",
    "reasoning": "Among the listed options, 'fruit salad' contains components (various kinds of fruit) that can be easily separated by hand or with simple tools, without the need for complex processes. Unlike bread, which ingredients are chemically changed and bonded during the baking process, ocean water and soda water, where the dissolved components (salt and carbon dioxide, respectively) require specific conditions or processes to be separated."
