Question: A boat is acted on by a river current flowing north and by wind blowing on its sails. The boat travels northeast. In which direction is the wind most likely applying force to the sails of the boat?
Options: ['west', 'east', 'north', 'south']
Answer: east

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "east",
    "reasoning": "Based on the given information, the boat is moving northeast, which means it is influenced by forces acting both from the north and the east. Since the river current is already providing the northern component of motion, the wind must be providing the eastern component. Thus, the wind is most likely applying force from the west towards the east to allow the boat to travel in a northeast direction."
