Model Answer: {
    "answer": "use of images from space",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, the use of images from space has directly contributed to the improvement of weather forecasting. Satellite imagery allows for real-time monitoring of weather systems globally, enhancing the ability to predict weather conditions accurately. None of the other options directly affect the accuracy of weather forecasts in the manner that satellite technology does."
