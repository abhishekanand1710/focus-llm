Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Gasoline comes from a limited resource.",
    "reasoning": "The motivation for using alternative fuels in some automobiles is primarily due to the fact that gasoline, a traditional fuel source, is derived from oil, which is a finite or limited resource. This limitation encourages the exploration and adoption of alternative fuels to ensure sustainability and reduce dependence on a depleting resource."
