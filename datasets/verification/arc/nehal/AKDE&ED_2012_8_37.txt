Question: An astronomer is studying two stars that are the same distance from Earth. Star X appears brighter than star Y. Which statement best explains this observation?
Options: ['Star X is larger than star Y.', 'Star Y is larger than star X.', 'Star X reflects the Sun’s light better than star Y.', 'Star Y reflects the Sun’s light better than star X.']
Answer: Star X is larger than star Y.

        "related_concept": "Reflection of the Sun\u2019s Light",
        "description": "Direct reflection of the Sun\u2019s light is not generally a significant factor in determining the apparent brightness of stars, as their own luminosity is the key factor."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Star X is larger than star Y.",
    "reasoning": "Given that both stars are the same distance from Earth, the main factor that would cause one star to appear brighter than the other is its size. Larger stars emit more light and therefore appear brighter when viewed from Earth. The options related to the reflection of the Sun\u2019s light do not apply to stars, as stars generate their own light rather than reflecting light from the Sun. Thus, 'Star X is larger than star Y.' is the best explanation for the observation."
