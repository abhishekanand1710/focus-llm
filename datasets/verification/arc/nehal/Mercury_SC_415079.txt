Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Put the water in a very cold place.",
    "reasoning": "Placing liquid water in a very cold place directly leads to a decrease in the water's temperature. When the temperature drops below the freezing point of 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F), the water transitions from a liquid to a solid state, effectively freezing it into ice. This process is the fundamental principle behind freezing water, as opposed to the options of heating (which does the opposite), shaking (which does not affect temperature), or adding salt (which lowers the freezing point, thus requiring an even colder environment for water to freeze)."
