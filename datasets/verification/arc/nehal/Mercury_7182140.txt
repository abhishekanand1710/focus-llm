Model Answer: {
    "answer": "carbon dioxide and water",
    "reasoning": "The most efficient form of cellular respiration is aerobic respiration, which uses oxygen to break down glucose and produce ATP. The end products of this process are carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), along with ATP. Therefore, the correct answer from the options provided is 'carbon dioxide and water', as they are the byproducts of aerobic respiration, the pathway that generates the most ATP."
