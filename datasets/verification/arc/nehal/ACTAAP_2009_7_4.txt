    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Neptune",
    "reasoning": "Based on the concept of what constitutes a planetary year, which is the time a planet takes to complete one orbit around the Sun, Neptune has the longest planetary year among the options provided. It takes about 164.8 Earth years for Neptune to complete one orbit around the Sun, making it the planet with the longest year compared to Earth's, Venus's, and Jupiter's years."
