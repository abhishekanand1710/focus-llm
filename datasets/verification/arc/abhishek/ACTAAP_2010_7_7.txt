Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Human beings shed millions of",
    "reasoning": "The best evidence that cell division is occurring constantly in our bodies is the fact that human beings shed millions of skin cells regularly. This process of shedding dead skin cells and replacing them with new ones indicates ongoing cell division, specifically in the epidermis. Unlike the other options which relate to broader physiological processes (such as breathing and food intake) or outcomes (such as tissue diversity), shedding skin cells directly evidences the regular occurrence of cell division to replenish the body's outermost layer."
