    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ability to convert sunlight into energy",
    "reasoning": "The function that makes a plant cell different from an animal cell is its ability to convert sunlight into energy. This is because plant cells contain chloroplasts, which conduct photosynthesis, a process unique to plants and certain algae that allows them to synthesize food from carbon dioxide and water using sunlight. This key difference centers around the presence of chloroplasts and the process of photosynthesis in plant cells."
