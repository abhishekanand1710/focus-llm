Question: How does the tilt of Earth’s axis and its rotation affect the weather?
Options: ['The tilt of Earth allows Earth to absorb all of the Sun’s radiation as it rotates.', 'The tilt allows certain latitudes of Earth to be heated at a greater rate while Earth rotates.', 'The tilt of Earth allows Earth to rotate fast enough to allow surface cooling to occur at night.', 'The tilt allows energy to be evenly distributed throughout the atmosphere while Earth rotates.']
Answer: The tilt allows certain latitudes of Earth to be heated at a greater rate while Earth rotates.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The tilt allows certain latitudes of Earth to be heated at a greater rate while Earth rotates.",
    "reasoning": "The tilt of Earth's axis results in different latitudes receiving varying amounts of solar radiation at different times of the year. This variance in solar intensity, combined with Earth's rotation, means that some latitudes are warmed more significantly than others, directly influencing weather patterns by creating zones of varying temperature and atmospheric pressure. This option most accurately reflects the conceptual relationship between Earth's axial tilt, rotation, and the differential heating of the planet's surface, which is fundamental to the development of weather patterns."
