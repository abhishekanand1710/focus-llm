Question: Clams, oysters, and mussels eat plankton filtered from water. How would clams, oysters, and mussels most likely be affected if the amount of plankton in a large body of water was significantly reduced?
Options: ['They would increase in number.', 'They would find a new food source.', 'They would become prey to other animals.', 'They would compete for a limited food source.']
Answer: They would compete for a limited food source.

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They would compete for a limited food source.",
    "reasoning": "Given that clams, oysters, and mussels rely on filtering plankton from water as their primary source of nutrition, a significant decrease in plankton quantity would lead to a scarcity of their food source. Since these marine mollusks depend on the same food, they will inevitably compete for the limited plankton available, as other options suggested (such as increasing in number or finding a new food source) are not immediately viable due to their specific dietary requirements and the immediate impact of reduced food availability."
