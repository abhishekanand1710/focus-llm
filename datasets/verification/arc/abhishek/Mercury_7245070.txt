Model Answer: {
    "answer": "hamburger patties",
    "reasoning": "Out of the options provided, hamburger patties are rich in proteins, which means they can be broken down into amino acids. This is because proteins, which are the primary component of hamburger patties, especially when made from meat, consist of amino acids. In contrast, the other options provide mainly carbohydrates or water and are not rich sources of proteins."
