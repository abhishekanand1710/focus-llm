Model Answer: {
    "answer": "once",
    "reasoning": "The Earth completes one full rotation on its axis in approximately 24 hours, which defines the length of a day. This relationship between Earth's rotation and the duration of a day directly implies that the Earth rotates on its axis once in one day."
