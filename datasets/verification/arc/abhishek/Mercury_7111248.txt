Model Answer: {
    "answer": "from Saturn to Mercury",
    "reasoning": "The Astronomical Unit (AU) is specifically defined as the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. It is most practically used within the Solar System, where it helps to express distances between the planets and the Sun in a comprehensible scale. The options involving distances from galaxy to galaxy or to Proxima Centauri involve scales far beyond the practical application of AUs, being more suitably measured in light-years or parsecs. The distances between constellations like the Big Dipper and Little Dipper, consist of stars at various distances from Earth and do not relate to specific distances that could be measured in AUs. Thus, the most appropriate use of the AU, based on the given options, is to describe distances within the Solar System, such as from Saturn to Mercury."
