Model Answer: {
    "answer": "making cars run on less fuel",
    "reasoning": "Of all the options provided, making cars run on less fuel directly addresses a core environmental issue: the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and associated emissions. This approach targets reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a significant aspect of combating climate change. In contrast, other options either potentially exacerbate environmental issues or have a less direct relation to environmental sustainability."
