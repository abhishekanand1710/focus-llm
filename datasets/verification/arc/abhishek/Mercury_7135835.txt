Question: A Mars Rover has been sent to explore and relay data from Mars. Mars is less massive than Earth. When compared with Earth, which is the best comparison between the mass and the weight of the Rover on Mars?
Options: ['The mass is more on Mars and the weight is less.', 'The weight is more on Mars and the mass is less.', 'The weight is less on Mars and the mass is the same.', 'The mass is less on Mars and the weight is the same.']
Answer: The weight is less on Mars and the mass is the same.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The weight is less on Mars and the mass is the same.",
    "reasoning": "Following the concepts and their relationships, the mass of an object (in this case, the Mars Rover) remains constant regardless of its location in the universe, while weight is the measure of the force of gravity on that object. Because Mars is less massive than Earth, its gravitational pull is weaker, resulting in lesser weight for objects on its surface compared to their weight on Earth, while their mass remains unchanged."
