Model Answer: {
    "answer": "succession",
    "reasoning": "The process that establishes a community on the exposed bedrock as a glacier melts and retreats is best described as 'succession.' This is because, following the exposure of the bedrock, organisms begin to colonize the newly available space, leading to the development of a biological community over time. This follows the relationship where the exposed bedrock becomes the foundation for succession, initiating the gradual development of an ecosystem, from bare rock to a mature community."
