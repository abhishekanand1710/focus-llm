]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The average molecular speed in the solid increases.",
    "reasoning": "As a solid is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases. This increase in kinetic energy directly correlates with an increase in the average molecular speed within the solid. The other options, such as decreasing kinetic energy, increasing average density, and decreasing specific heat capacity, do not typically result from heating a solid."
