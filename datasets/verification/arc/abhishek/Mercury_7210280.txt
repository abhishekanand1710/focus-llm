Question: Because water can hold a large amount of heat, which effect do oceans have on nearby land areas?
Options: ['They prevent rapid extreme temperature changes.', 'They form high-pressure areas that cause magma currents.', 'They provide the energy that triggers volcanic events.', 'They lower the freezing point of fresh water.']
Answer: They prevent rapid extreme temperature changes.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They prevent rapid extreme temperature changes.",
    "reasoning": "Oceans have a high specific heat capacity, which allows them to absorb large amounts of heat without a significant change in temperature. This property enables oceans to regulate the temperature of nearby land areas by moderating temperature extremes. Therefore, oceans prevent rapid extreme temperature changes in surrounding areas."
