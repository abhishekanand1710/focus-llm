Model Answer: {
    "answer": "once-living organisms",
    "reasoning": "Coal and natural gas are fossil fuels formed from the remains of once-living organisms, particularly plants and animals, that have been subjected to high pressure and temperature over millions of years. The other options provided: cold-water oceans, erupting volcanoes, and forest fires, do not directly play a role in the formation of these types of fuels."
