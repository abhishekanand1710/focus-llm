Question: Which of the following factors would most likely cause a hurricane to decrease in strength?
Options: ['staying over a warm body of water for a long time.', 'increasing the number of large clouds.', 'moving over a continent.', 'moving toward tropical waters.']
Answer: moving over a continent.

    },

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "moving over a continent.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the identified concepts and relationships, a hurricane decreases in strength when it moves over a continent because this action deprives it of the warm, moist environment (provided by warm bodies of water) that it requires to sustain and gain strength. Moving over land interrupts the hurricane's energy source, leading to dissipation."
