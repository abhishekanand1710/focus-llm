]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "year",
    "reasoning": "Based on the described concepts and their relationships, Earth makes a complete revolution around the Sun about once every year. This is because a year measures the time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun, which directly corresponds to the definition of a revolution in the context of planetary movement."
