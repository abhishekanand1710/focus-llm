Model Answer: {
    "answer": "line graph",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, a line graph is the best way to present the daily temperatures converted from Fahrenheit to Celsius for the past month. It visually displays the changes over time, allowing for easy comparison of temperature trends. While a table could also organize this data effectively, it does not provide the same immediate visual insight into the fluctuations and trends that a line graph offers. The conversion process itself is handled through a formula, but presenting the converted temperatures is most effectively achieved with a line graph. A pie chart is less suitable for this task as it is designed to show parts of a whole, not trends over time."
