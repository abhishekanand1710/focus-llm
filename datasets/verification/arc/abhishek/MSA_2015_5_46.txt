Question: A beaker containing 50 milliliters of ice is placed on a windowsill. After several hours, the ice melts. What property of the ice did not change when it melted?
Options: ['the mass', 'the volume', 'the temperature', 'the state of matter']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the mass",
    "reasoning": "When ice melts into water, its state of matter changes from solid to liquid, the volume may change due to the density difference between solid ice and liquid water, and the temperature that initiates melting changes as the ice absorbs heat. However, the mass of the water remains the same before and after melting, as the matter (ice) simply changes form without any of it being lost or gained in the process. Thus, the property of the ice that does not change when it melted is the mass."
