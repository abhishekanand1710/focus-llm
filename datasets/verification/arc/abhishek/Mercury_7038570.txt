Question: Students are learning about different types of waves. Which is the least likely way for the students to generate a wave?
Options: ['by tossing a ball in the air', 'by shaking the ends of a rope', 'by throwing a pebble into a pool of water', 'by pulling on a coiled spring toy']
Answer: by tossing a ball in the air

        "description": "This action does not generate waves in a medium around it."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "by tossing a ball in the air",
    "reasoning": "Tossing a ball in the air does not create a wave in a medium around it, unlike shaking a rope, throwing a pebble into water, or pulling on a coiled spring toy, all of which generate mechanical waves in their respective mediums."
