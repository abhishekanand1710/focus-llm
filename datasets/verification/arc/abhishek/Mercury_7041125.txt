Model Answer: {
    "answer": "automobiles",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, automobiles are known to be the greatest contributor to air pollution in the United States. The exhaust from millions of vehicles on the road contributes significantly to air pollution levels, particularly in terms of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Each of the other options indeed contributes to air pollution but automobiles, with their widespread use and the sheer volume of emissions produced, are considered the primary source of air pollutants in the urban settings of the United States."
