Model Answer: {
    "answer": "move closer together and have less kinetic energy.",
    "reasoning": "As mercury transitions from a liquid to a solid state, its atoms move closer together, reflecting a decrease in average atomic or molecular distance. This transition also corresponds with a reduction in the kinetic energy of its atoms because their movement becomes more restricted in the solid state. This is a direct consequence of energy states transitioning, where less energy (in the form of kinetic energy) is present in the solid state compared to the liquid state."
