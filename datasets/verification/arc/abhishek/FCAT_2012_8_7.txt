Question: Food webs show feeding relationships among different types of organisms. Those organisms each have a specific niche. Which of the following best describes a function of decomposers in food webs?
Options: ['to recycle nutrients into soil', 'to convert solar energy into food', 'to provide food for secondary consumers', 'to compete with secondary consumers for oxygen']
Answer: to recycle nutrients into soil

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "to recycle nutrients into soil",
    "reasoning": "Decomposers play a critical role in food webs by breaking down dead organisms and waste products. This process not only disposes of dead material but also recycles nutrients back into the ecosystem, enriching the soil and making the nutrients available for use by plants and other organisms. This function is crucial for the sustenance of ecosystem health and productivity, unlike the other options which are not directly associated with the primary role of decomposers."
