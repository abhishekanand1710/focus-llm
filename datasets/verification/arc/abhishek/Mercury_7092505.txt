Model Answer: {
    "answer": "uplifting and faulting",
    "reasoning": "Uplifting and faulting are geological processes capable of causing significant structural alterations in the Earth's crust. These processes can lead to the inversion of rock layers, where forces from the Earth's movements elevate some sections of rock layers and disrupt the original sequencing. This can result in younger rock layers being positioned below older layers due to the intense structural rearrangement, aligning with the observations described in the question."
