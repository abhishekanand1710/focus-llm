Question: Biologists are studying the white-tailed deer population in Ohio. Which question could the biologists most likely answer?
Options: ['How fast does this deer population grow?', 'What percentage of people enjoy watching deer?', 'Does this deer population like warmer states?', 'Should people raise deer as pets?']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "How fast does this deer population grow?",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, the question about the growth rate of the white-tailed deer population in Ohio is the most likely to be answered by biologists due to its direct relation to the study of population dynamics, which is a fundamental aspect of wildlife biology. This question is specifically focused on the biological aspects of the deer population, unlike the other options which touch on social preferences, speculative habitat preferences without specific context, and the topic of domestication which falls outside the typical scope of wildlife population studies."
