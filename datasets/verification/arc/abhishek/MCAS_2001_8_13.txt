Question: Scientists claim that the continents of South America and Africa were once a single landmass. All of the following observations support this claim except
Options: ['the mountains on these continents have similar rocks of the same age.', 'these continents appear to fit together like the pieces of a puzzle.', 'similar fish live in the ocean off the coasts of these continents.', 'the same kinds of fossils have been found on these continents.']
Answer: similar fish live in the ocean off the coasts of these continents.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "similar fish live in the ocean off the coasts of these continents.",
    "reasoning": "The theory of Continental Drift and the once singular landmass of South America and Africa is supported by geological evidence such as similar rocks and fossil records, as well as the physical geography of their coastlines. The presence of similar fish species in the oceans adjacent to these continents, however, is less a product of the continents' historical connection and more attributable to the marine life's ability to disperse and evolve independently in the ocean. Thus, marine life distribution does not directly support the claim of the continents being a single landmass, as ocean currents and similar environmental conditions can lead to similar species developing independently."
