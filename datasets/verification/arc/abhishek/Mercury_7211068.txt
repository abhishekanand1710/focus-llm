    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "digestive",
    "reasoning": "The digestive system uses layers of smooth muscle tissue to contract and move solid and liquid nutrients and waste through the body. This is due to its essential role in processing ingested food, absorbing nutrients, and expelling waste, utilizing smooth muscle movements to propel the contents through the gastrointestinal tract."
