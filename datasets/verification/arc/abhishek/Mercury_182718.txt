Question: Birds that do not receive adequate nutrition during development sing less often and for shorter periods of time as adult birds. Which best describes the outcome of nutritional stress in these songbirds?
Options: ['They are less likely to ward off predators.', 'They are less likely to obtain good nesting sites.', 'They are less likely to find adequate food supplies.', 'They are less likely to attract mates and pass on their genes.']
Answer: They are less likely to attract mates and pass on their genes.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They are less likely to attract mates and pass on their genes.",
    "reasoning": "Nutritional stress during development leads to birds singing less often and for shorter durations, which are critical aspects of attracting mates in many bird species. This, in turn, negatively affects their mating success, making them less likely to attract mates and subsequently less likely to pass on their genes. The relationships between nutritional stress, song frequency and duration, mating success, and genetic transmission underscore the importance of adequate nutrition for the reproductive success of songbirds."
