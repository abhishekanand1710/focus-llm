Question: Paleontologists construct a model of a dinosaur from its fossil bones and teeth. The fossil bones and teeth can help the paleontologists to infer all of the following about the dinosaur except
Options: ['height of the dinosaur.', 'type of food the dinosaur ate.', 'length of the dinosaur.', 'skin color of the dinosaur.']
Answer: skin color of the dinosaur.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "skin color of the dinosaur.",
    "reasoning": "Paleontologists can infer a lot about dinosaurs from their fossil bones and teeth, such as their height, length, and diet based on the shape and wear of teeth. However, these fossils do not preserve information about the skin color of the dinosaur, which requires different types of evidence, often not preserved in the fossil record."
