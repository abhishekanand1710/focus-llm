Key: Mercury_7187005

Question: One effect of ocean pollution is that it can reduce populations of phytoplankton and algae. The reduction of these populations might have which impact on an ecosystem?
Options: ['decreasing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere', 'decreasing the amount of oxygen being produced', 'increasing the amount of marine sediments', 'increasing salt-water fish populations']
Answer: decreasing the amount of oxygen being produced

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "decreasing the amount of oxygen being produced",
    "reasoning": "The reduction of phytoplankton and algae populations due to ocean pollution would directly impact the ecosystem's ability to produce oxygen. Since these organisms are key producers of oxygen through photosynthesis, their decrease would result in less oxygen being produced, negatively affecting the oxygen levels in the ecosystem."
