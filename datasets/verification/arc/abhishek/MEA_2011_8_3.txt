Model Answer: {
    "answer": "North Pole",
    "reasoning": "On December 22, which is the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere, the North Pole experiences the least intense sunlight compared to the other options listed. In fact, the North Pole receives no sunlight at all on this day, entering a continuous period of darkness known as the polar night."
