Model Answer: {
    "answer": "protection of private information",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, the most direct benefit to customers using fingerprint payment technology is the protection of private information. This technology involves using sensitive personal data (fingerprints) for transactions, thus making the safeguarding and protection of this information crucial to maintaining user trust and security. The system inherently requires robust privacy measures to prevent unauthorized access to users' payment information and biometric data, thereby offering significant value in protecting customers' private information."
