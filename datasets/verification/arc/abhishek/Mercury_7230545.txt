]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "deflection of water toward the direction of airflow",
    "reasoning": "Wind drag exerts a force on the surface of the ocean, influencing the movement and direction of ocean surface currents. This force results in the deflection of water towards the direction of the airflow. The relationships outlined show how wind drag and its effect on ocean surface currents lead to deflection as the primary feature of these currents in response to wind."
