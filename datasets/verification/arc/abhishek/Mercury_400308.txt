Model Answer: {
    "answer": "coming when called",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, 'coming when called' is the best example of a learned behavior as it directly involves training and commands that the dog learns to follow. Unlike barking or tail-wagging, which are more instinctual and can be displayed without specific training, or digging a hole, which can be both a natural instinct and a product of stimulation, 'coming when called' expressly requires the dog to learn and respond to specific vocal commands given by humans."
