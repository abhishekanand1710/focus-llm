Question: The Periodic Table of the Elements is arranged so that elements with similar characteristics are in the same column. Which element is a highly reactive metal?
Options: ['chlorine (Cl)', 'helium (He)', 'magnesium (Mg)', 'silver (Ag)']
Answer: magnesium (Mg)

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "magnesium (Mg)",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, magnesium (Mg) is the only element that fits the description of being a 'highly reactive metal.' Chlorine is a highly reactive nonmetal; helium is a noble gas with very low reactivity; and silver, while a metal, is not highly reactive. Therefore, based on its classification in the Periodic Table and its known high reactivity, magnesium (Mg) is the correct answer."
