Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Wind turbines are efficient only in certain areas.",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is 'Wind turbines are efficient only in certain areas.' This is because wind turbines' efficiency heavily depends on the geographical location, which includes factors such as wind speed and consistency. Locations with higher and more consistent wind speeds produce more energy. Unlike the other options presented, which are generally not considered significant issues with wind turbines (e.g., they generally occupy a relatively small area of land per unit of energy produced, produce significant amounts of energy, and create minimal pollution), the variability in efficiency depending on location is a well-known limitation of wind energy production."
