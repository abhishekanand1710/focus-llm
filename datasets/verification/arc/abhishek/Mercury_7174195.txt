Question: A perpetual motion machine is a theoretical device which, once started, continues to operate without any additional input of energy. Which statement describes why a perpetual motion machine is impossible to design?
Options: ['Energy can be converted into mass.', 'Friction reduces the efficiency in a system.', 'The amount of energy in a system remains constant.', 'Potential energy can be converted into kinetic energy.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "'Friction reduces the efficiency in a system.'",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, the impossibility of designing a perpetual motion machine is best explained by the concept that 'Friction reduces the efficiency in a system.' Friction is an omnipresent force that opposes motion between surfaces in contact, leading to energy losses as heat. This energy loss necessitates additional energy input to maintain motion, contrary to the concept of a perpetual motion machine, which operates without external energy input. This directly relates to the principle that in real-world systems, energy is not 100% efficiently transformed due to losses, chiefly through friction, making a perpetual motion machine impractical according to the laws of physics, especially the Second Law of Thermodynamics."
