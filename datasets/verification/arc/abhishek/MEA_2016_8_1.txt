Question: A fox gave birth to an offspring that had a better sense of hearing than most foxes. How could this small change most likely result in descendants that are different from the original fox?
Options: ['Foxes that have a better sense of hearing may mutate more frequently than other foxes.', 'Foxes that have a better sense of hearing may be hunted more frequently.', 'Over time, descendants of this fox may hear and hunt prey better than other foxes.', 'Over time, descendants of this fox may become extinct.']
Answer: Over time, descendants of this fox may hear and hunt prey better than other foxes.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Over time, descendants of this fox may hear and hunt prey better than other foxes.",
    "reasoning": "The fox with better hearing has a mutation that results in a survival advantage; it can detect predators and prey more efficiently. This trait can be passed down to its descendants through heritability, leading to natural selection that favors those with better hearing. Over time, this can result in an evolutionary path where descendants are better hunters due to their superior hearing capabilities."
