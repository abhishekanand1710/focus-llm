    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "coal",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, coal is the resource that, when used, causes the most pollution. The process of burning coal for electricity generation releases significant amounts of pollutants into the environment, including carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, making it far more polluting compared to the non-polluting or minimally polluting alternatives such as solar, wind, and water."
