Question: In which way are rainforests and coral reefs different from ecosystems with few species?
Options: ['There are more prey than predators.', 'The food web is more stable and lasting.', 'Organisms often must compete for food.', 'Plant populations are the primary producers.']
Answer: The food web is more stable and lasting.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The food web is more stable and lasting.",
    "reasoning": "Rainforests and coral reefs differ from ecosystems with few species by having a more complex and interconnected food web, which contributes to their stability and lasting nature. Due to the high biodiversity found in rainforests and coral reefs, the food web consists of multiple layers and interdependencies that can absorb changes and disturbances better than ecosystems with fewer species. This complexity and variety in species leads to a more resilient ecosystem where the loss of one species can be compensated by others, ensuring ecosystem stability and longevity."
