Model Answer: {
    "answer": "provide better gas mileage.",
    "reasoning": "The design and integration of electric motors with gasoline engines in electric-gasoline-hybrid vehicles are primarily aimed at enhancing fuel efficiency, which translates to better gas mileage. This is achieved by using the electric motor for low-power demands and gasoline engine for higher power demands, thereby conserving fuel more effectively than vehicles that rely solely on gasoline engines. The relationships identified highlight that while hybrids use fossil fuels and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, their main design goal is improving gas mileage compared to similar-sized gasoline-powered vehicles."
