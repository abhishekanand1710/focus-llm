Model Answer: {
    "answer": "baking soda and vinegar",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, only the combination of baking soda and vinegar results in a chemical reaction where new substances are formed, such as carbon dioxide gas, water, and a salt. This aligns with the definition of a chemical combination where two or more substances combine to form a new substance with different properties."
