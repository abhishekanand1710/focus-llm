Model Answer: {
    "answer": "balance",
    "reasoning": "A balance is a device specifically designed to measure the mass of objects. In the context of determining the mass of 2 teaspoons of sand, the balance is the necessary piece of laboratory equipment because the question explicitly asks for the mass of the sand, which is what balances measure. None of the other options (glass beaker, eye dropper, graduated cylinder) are designed to measure mass. Beakers and graduated cylinders measure volume, while an eye dropper is used for transferring small amounts of liquid, none of which are suitable for determining the mass of sand."
