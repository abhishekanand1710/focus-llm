Question: Robots can perform tasks that are dangerous for humans. What is the MAJOR limitation to the use of robots?
Options: ['The assembly pieces must be very small.', 'The assembly process must remain exactly the same.', 'Robots require regular maintenance.', 'Robots must be provided with electricity.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Robots require regular maintenance.",
    "reasoning": "Among the listed options, the major limitation for the use of robots is that they require regular maintenance. This is because, despite the capability to perform hazardous tasks and the necessity for electricity, the ongoing need for maintenance impacts both the operational readiness and the lifetime cost of employing robots. This entails consistent checkups and potentially costly repairs to ensure functionality, efficiency, and safety, which significantly affects the practical and financial feasibility of using robots broadly. The assembly pieces size and whether the assembly process must remain the same, while relevant, are not as broadly limiting because robots can be designed or programmed for different sizes and adaptable to varying processes; however, overcoming or minimizing the maintenance requirement poses a more complex challenge."
