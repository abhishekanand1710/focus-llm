Question: The ocean water near the equator absorbs more heat throughout the year than ocean water near the North Pole. Which of the following best explains this difference?
Options: ['The equator is closer to the Sun.', 'The equator has higher sea levels.', 'The equator receives more direct sunlight.', "The equator rotates more quickly on Earth's axis."]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The equator receives more direct sunlight.",
    "reasoning": "The reason why ocean water near the Equator absorbs more heat throughout the year than ocean water near the North Pole is because it receives more direct sunlight. This is a result of the Earth's curvature and its axial tilt, ensuring the Equator is consistently exposed to direct and intense solar rays compared to the poles. Direct sunlight carries more energy, leading to greater heat absorption in the regions it strikes more directly, which in this case is the Equatorial regions."
