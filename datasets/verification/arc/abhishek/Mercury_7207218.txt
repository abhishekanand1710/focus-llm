Question: Which is the best evidence that rocks found deep underground were once exposed at the surface?
Options: ['The rocks have been melted by a magma.', 'The rocks have been broken by faults.', 'The rocks have been weathered by water.', 'The rocks have been folded by pressure.']
Answer: The rocks have been weathered by water.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The rocks have been weathered by water.",
    "reasoning": "Among the provided options, 'The rocks have been weathered by water.' is the best evidence that rocks found deep underground were once exposed at the surface. This conclusion is based on the understanding that weathering by water is a surface or near-surface process affecting rocks exposed to the Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere. The relationships mapped out illustrate that while other processes indicate geological activity, only weathering by water directly implies prior exposure to surface conditions."
