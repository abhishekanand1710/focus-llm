Question: Michael has a pencil case made of pine wood. The surface of the pencil case scratches and dents easily. He wants to make a new pencil case that will not scratch or dent easily. Which of the following should Michael do to make a new pencil case that will not scratch or dent easily?
Options: ['make the pencil case a different size', 'use a different material to make the pencil case', 'make the pencil case from another piece of pine wood', 'use a thicker piece of pine wood to make the pencil case']
Answer: use a different material to make the pencil case

Model Response:
Concepts: [

        "name": "Pine Wood",
        "description": "A type of softwood that is prone to scratches and dents due to its softer nature."

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "use a different material to make the pencil case",
    "reasoning": "Since the durability of a material, especially in terms of resistance to scratches and dents, is significantly influenced by the type of material used, choosing a more durable material than pine wood would directly address Michael's concern. The concepts and their relationships highlight that while the size and thickness of the pine wood might have minor implications on overall strength, they do not fundamentally change the pine wood's susceptibility to scratches and dents. Therefore, using a different, more durable material is the most effective solution."
