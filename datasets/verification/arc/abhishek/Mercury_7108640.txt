Question: A scientist investigated the effect of workplace stress on heart disease in humans. Men of various ages were divided into two groups based on whether they described their work as very stressful or not very stressful. During the one year investigation the scientist monitored the heart health of each man. What was the bias in this investigation?
Options: ['The investigation only lasted one year.', 'The only organ studied was the heart.', 'The investigation tested only men.', 'The age of the participants varied.']
Answer: The investigation tested only men.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The investigation tested only men.",
    "reasoning": "The bias in the investigation comes from testing only men, which limits the generalizability of the results. While workplace stress, heart disease, and the duration of the study are relevant factors, the choice to include only male participants means the findings may not accurately represent the effects of workplace stress on heart disease in the entire human population, including women. This research design overlooks gender differences in heart disease and stress response, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between workplace stress and heart health."
