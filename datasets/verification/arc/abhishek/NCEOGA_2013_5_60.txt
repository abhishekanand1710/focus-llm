Model Answer: {
    "answer": "shape of earlobes",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, the shape of earlobes is the trait most directly and purely inherited from parents via genetics, with minimal influence from environmental factors. While traits like musical ability and personality have genetic components, they are significantly influenced by the environment. Language is predominantly learned through social interaction and is not genetically inherited."
