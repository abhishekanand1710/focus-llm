    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "graduated cylinder and balance",
    "reasoning": "To determine the density of rock samples, the mass and volume of the samples are required. The mass is measured with a balance, and the volume can be measured through water displacement using a graduated cylinder. These measurements allow for the calculation of density, making the 'graditated cylinder and balance' option the correct choice."
