Question: Which event occurs on a daily cycle?
Options: ['The Sun rises and sets.', 'Earth tilts on its axis.', 'Earth revolves around the Sun.', 'The Moon revolves around Earth.']
Answer: The Sun rises and sets.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The Sun rises and sets.",
    "reasoning": "The occurrence of the Sun rising and setting happens on a daily cycle due to Earth's rotation on its axis. This daily event is distinct from the other options as they describe processes with longer durations: Earth's tilt affects seasons but is a constant characteristic rather than a cyclical event, Earth's revolution around the Sun defines a year, and the Moon's orbit around Earth defines a month."
