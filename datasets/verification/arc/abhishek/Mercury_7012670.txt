Model Answer: {
    "answer": "heavy metals threaten some forms of life.",
    "reasoning": "Heavy metals, including lead and mercury, are known to be toxic and can pose serious threats to the health and survival of various forms of life. These metals can accumulate in biological systems, leading to poisoning and various health issues, hence the concern of scientists regarding their presence in the environment."
