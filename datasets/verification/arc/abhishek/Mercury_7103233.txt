Question: Which question can be answered using an investigation done by a science class?
Options: ['What is the climate on Jupiter?', 'Do plants grow differently with and without light?', 'Where is the warmest place on Earth that has life?', 'How far do monarch butterflies migrate?']
Answer: Do plants grow differently with and without light?

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Do plants grow differently with and without light?",
    "reasoning": "This question can be directly investigated in a science class through experiments involving plants grown in different conditions related to light exposure. By observing and measuring the growth of plants kept in light vs. those kept in darkness, students can apply the concepts of photosynthesis and its impact on plant growth, making it a feasible and educational investigation."
