Question: The weight of heavy machinery compacts soil, especially when it is wet. Why do farmers avoid driving their machinery across wet ground?
Options: ['Compacted soil will absorb too much water.', 'Plants cannot grow when soil is compacted.', 'Minerals are destroyed when soil is compacted.', 'Compacted soil increases soil acidity.']
Answer: Plants cannot grow when soil is compacted.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Plants cannot grow when soil is compacted.",
    "reasoning": "The primary reason farmers avoid driving machinery across wet ground is due to soil compaction, which hinders plant growth. This is because compacted soil reduces the pore space between soil particles, making it difficult for plant roots to grow, for water to infiltrate, and for air to circulate within the soil. This relationship between heavy machinery causing soil compaction, especially in wet conditions, and the negative impact on plant growth, outlines the clear reasoning for avoiding such practices to maintain soil health and ensure optimal plant development."
