    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The researchers can share their ideas.",
    "reasoning": "The main advantage of working in teams, in the context of making cars more fuel efficient, is the facilitation of idea sharing. This collaborative environment allows for the pooling of diverse knowledge and skills, leading to more innovative solutions for improving fuel efficiency. The other options, while they may be benefits of teamwork, are not directly linked to the primary function of teamwork in a research setting, which is to enhance the sharing and development of ideas."
