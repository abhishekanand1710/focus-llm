Question: Students measure the effect of water on the growth of plants for a lab experiment. The students give different amounts of water to three different groups of plants. All plants receive the same amount of light and are planted in the same amount of soil. The students then measure the height of the plants over a period of four weeks. Which variables should be labeled on the axes to graph the data collected in this experiment?
Options: ['Amount of Water vs. Height of Plants', 'Temperature vs. Amount of Sunlight', 'Amount of Water vs. Amount of Soil', 'Amount of Sunlight vs. Height of Plants']
Answer: Amount of Water vs. Height of Plants

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Amount of Water vs. Height of Plants",
    "reasoning": "The experiment is designed to measure the effect of different amounts of water on the growth of plants, specifically their height over a period of four weeks. Thus, the independent variable 'Amount of Water' that is being manipulated should be on one axis (typically the x-axis), and the dependent variable 'Height of Plants' that is being measured in response should be on the other axis (typically the y-axis). The other options involve variables that are not directly manipulated or measured in this experiment."
