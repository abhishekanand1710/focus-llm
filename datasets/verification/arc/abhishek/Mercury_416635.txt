Question: Sam was listing the differences between a euglena and a paramecium. Which characteristic should not be on Sam's list?
Options: ['only the euglena can respond to light', 'only the euglena have a definite shape', 'only the euglena use a flagellum to move', 'only the euglena can make their own food']
Answer: only the euglena have a definite shape

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "only the euglena have a definite shape",
    "reasoning": "This statement should not be on Sam's list because it is incorrect. Unlike a paramecium, which generally maintains a definite, somewhat fixed shape due to its pellicle, euglena are known for their more flexible cell membrane that allows them to change shape. Therefore, suggesting that only euglena have a definite shape is inaccurate as it is actually the other way around, with paramecium having a more definite shape compared to euglena."
