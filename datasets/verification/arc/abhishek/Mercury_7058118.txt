Key: Mercury_7058118

Question: A student is using descriptions to classify organisms. One organism is described as having sense organs to detect heat, laying eggs to reproduce, using venom for protection, and having the ability to change body temperature with its surroundings. How would the student classify this organism?
Options: ['bacteria', 'mammal', 'reptile', 'bird']
Answer: reptile

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "reptile",
    "reasoning": "The described organism matches the traits of reptiles, which are known to have sense organs to detect heat (like pit vipers), use venom for protection (such as some snakes), lay eggs, and have the ability to change their body temperature with their surroundings, being ectothermic. None of the other options (bacteria, mammal, bird) fit all these traits simultaneously."
