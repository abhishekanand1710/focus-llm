Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Air",
    "reasoning": "Based on the identified concepts and their relationships, it's clear that 'Soap bubbles' are primarily filled with 'Air' as they contain the gas inside their thin films, which is essential for their formation and sustenance. While soap and water are integral to their structure and formation process, the actual contents of a bubble, once formed, are air or sometimes other gases. Hence, 'Air' is the correct answer from the provided options."
