Model Answer: {
    "answer": "adapt to their environment",
    "reasoning": "Duck's feathers being covered with a natural oil that keeps them dry is an adaptation that facilitates their survival in watery environments. This feature allows them to maintain insulation and buoyancy, which are essential for searching for food, evading predators, and overall survival, hence helping them adapt to their environment."
