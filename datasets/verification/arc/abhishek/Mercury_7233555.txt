Model Answer: {
    "answer": "asthenosphere",
    "reasoning": "The asthenosphere is the semi-fluid upper layer of the mantle that is found directly below the lithosphere. It is the source of the magma that feeds volcanic eruptions, as this magma rises through the crust to the surface, becoming lava. Therefore, it is the correct answer since it is directly involved in the process of producing the lava that erupts from volcanoes."
