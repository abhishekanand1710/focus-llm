Question: A car is traveling on a highway at a constant velocity. Which statement best describes the forces acting on the car?
Options: ['The forces acting on the car are balanced.', 'The forces acting on the car are in the same direction.', 'The forces acting on the car are continuing to increase.', 'The forces acting on the car are equal to the force of gravity.']
Answer: The forces acting on the car are balanced.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The forces acting on the car are balanced.",
    "reasoning": "Given the car is traveling at a constant velocity, it implies that it is not accelerating, indicating that the forces acting on it are balanced. This is because, for a car to travel at a consistent speed in a straight line, the forward force generated by the car\u2019s engine must be exactly balanced by the forces of friction and air resistance opposing it. Additionally, the gravitational force pulling the car downward is balanced by the normal force of the road pushing it upward."
