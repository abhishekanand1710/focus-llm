Question: A medical research team is trying to determine whether a cream that is rubbed on the chest will help reduce the coughing associated with a particular illness. The team conducts the research using several groups of people. Which step will most likely result in producing a dependent (responding) variable that will help validate their research?
Options: ['using a different amount of people in each trial', 'writing down the names of the people in the study', 'monitoring the reaction of each person in the study', 'applying the same amount of cream to each person']
Answer: applying the same amount of cream to each person

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "monitoring the reaction of each person in the study",
    "reasoning": "Monitoring the reaction of each person in the study directly involves measuring the outcome or response (i.e., the dependent variable), which in this context is the effectiveness of the cream in reducing coughing associated with the illness. This step is crucial for obtaining valid and reliable data to validate their research. By observing and documenting the effects of the cough reduction cream on each participant, the medical research team can accurately assess whether the treatment achieves its intended purpose. This process transforms subjective observations into quantifiable data that represent the dependent variable."
