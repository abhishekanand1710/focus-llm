Key: Mercury_184293

Question: Which of these statements is most accurate about the Sun?
Options: ['It has an infinite energy supply.', 'It is near the end of its life cycle.', 'It is in its infancy in terms of energy consumption.', 'It has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.']
Answer: It has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.

    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the concepts and their relationships, the most accurate statement is that the Sun has consumed approximately one-half of its expendable energy. It does not have an infinite energy supply and is not at the beginning or the near end of its life cycle. It is approximately halfway through its main sequence phase, having consumed a significant part of its nuclear fuel but still having enough to last for approximately another 5 billion years."
