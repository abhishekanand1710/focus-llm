]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "hardness",
    "reasoning": "Since both the statue and the table are made of the same type of marble, it is their composition, in this case marble, that primarily determines their hardness. Marble, being a specific material, has a characteristic hardness that does not change regardless of the object's shape, size, or weight. Thus, the hardness of both the statue and the table will most likely be the same, as they are made of the same material."
