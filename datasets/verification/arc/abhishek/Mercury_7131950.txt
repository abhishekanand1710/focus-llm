Model Answer: {
    "answer": "iron becomes rusty",
    "reasoning": "Iron becoming rusty is a chemical change because it involves the reaction of iron with oxygen and water to form a new substance, rust. This is distinct from the other options, which are examples of physical changes where the substances involved do not change their chemical composition but only their physical form or appearance."
