Key: MDSA_2008_8_26

Question: Use the information to answer the question. Over the last 150 years, the use of fossil fuels has increased, resulting in more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Some scientists think that these atmospheric gases will result in global warming. Scientists have recorded data on global temperature changes and have predicted possible changes in sea level that may affect Maryland residents. Which result of global warming will most negatively affect coastal residents in Maryland?
Options: ['loss of shore land', 'erosion of mountains', 'decrease in average temperature', 'increase in the size of the polar ice caps']
Answer: loss of shore land

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "loss of shore land",
    "reasoning": "Based on the concepts and their relationships, the most direct impact of global warming on coastal residents in Maryland would be the loss of shore land. This is because the burning of fossil fuels increases the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming. Global warming, in turn, causes the sea level to rise. The rise in sea level directly results in the loss of shore land, affecting coastal residents in Maryland by potentially reducing the amount of land available and threatening infrastructure and homes."
