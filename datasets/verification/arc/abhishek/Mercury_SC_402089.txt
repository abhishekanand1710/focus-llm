Question: Stout beardfish live in the deep ocean. They live so far down that there is no light. Which characteristic would best help stout beardfish to survive in the dark?
Options: ['a mouth full of bristles', 'a brightly colored body', 'the ability to swim quickly', 'two whiskers that locate food']
Answer: two whiskers that locate food

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "two whiskers that locate food",
    "reasoning": "In the deep ocean environment where there is no light, the ability to visually find food is redundant. Therefore, adaptations that help locate food in the absence of light are critical for survival. 'Two whiskers that locate food' serve as a sensory mechanism to detect food in complete darkness, making it the most suitable adaptation for stout beardfish living in these conditions. The other options do not directly address the critical survival challenge of locating food without visual cues."
