Question: When a plant wilts, the stomata close. How does this help the plant?
Options: ['It increases photosynthesis.', 'It reduces further water loss.', 'It increases cellular respiration.', 'It reduces water intake by roots.']
Answer: It reduces further water loss.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It reduces further water loss.",
    "reasoning": "When a plant begins to wilt, closing the stomata helps to reduce further water loss by minimizing the amount of water vapor that escapes through these tiny openings. This reduction in water loss is critical for preventing further dehydration and potential damage to the plant, allowing it to conserve its remaining water supply."
