Question: Mara planted six pots of lettuce seeds. She placed three pots in a sunny area and three pots in a shaded area. She watered each pot the same and measured the growth of the lettuce. After Mara analyzes her data, what conclusion will it help her to make?
Options: ['When to plant her lettuce', 'Where to plant her lettuce', 'How much water to give lettuce', 'How many lettuce plants to grow']
Answer: Where to plant her lettuce

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Where to plant her lettuce",
    "reasoning": "By comparing the growth of lettuce seeds in sunny versus shaded areas, Mara's experiment is designed to determine the effect of sunlight on plant growth. The consistent watering across all pots ensures that the difference in growth is attributable to sunlight exposure rather than hydration levels. Therefore, the data analysis from this experiment will help Mara conclude where to plant her lettuce to achieve optimal growth, making 'Where to plant her lettuce' the correct answer."
