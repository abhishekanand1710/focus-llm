Question: Two pure substances combine to make a new substance. The new substance cannot be physically separated and has a different boiling point than each of the original substances. This new substance can best be classified as
Options: ['an atom.', 'a mixture.', 'an element.', 'a compound.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a compound.",
    "reasoning": "The described scenario involves two pure substances combining to form a new substance that cannot be physically separated and possesses a different boiling point than the original substances. This definition aligns with that of a compound, which is a substance formed when two or more chemical elements are chemically bonded together. Mixtures can be separated physically, elements are pure substances themselves and cannot be formed by combining other substances, and atoms are the basic units of matter and not formed by combination. Therefore, the correct classification is 'a compound.'"
