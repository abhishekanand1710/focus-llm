Question: When a volcano erupts, lava flows out from the top. What type of rock is formed as the lava cools?
Options: ['magma', 'igneous', 'sedimentary', 'metamorphic']

    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "igneous",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is 'igneous rock' because it is formed through the cooling and solidification of lava that flows out from a volcano during an eruption. This process directly correlates with the description of how igneous rocks are created, differing fundamentally from the processes that form sedimentary and metamorphic rocks."
