Question: Scientists are collecting samples from sediment deposits in Biscayne Bay. Test results show that salinity in the bay is increasing. Which human influence might have led to this environmental change?
Options: ['establishing the bay as a national park in 1980', 'finding sunken ships resting on the floor of the bay', 'collecting marine animals from the bottom of the bay', 'developing power plants along the shoreline of the bay']
Answer: developing power plants along the shoreline of the bay

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "developing power plants along the shoreline of the bay",
    "reasoning": "The development of power plants along the shoreline is the most plausible human influence leading to an increase in salinity in Biscayne Bay. Power plants often use water from nearby bodies for cooling and then discharge it back at higher temperatures and potentially with higher salinity, depending on the cooling process and source of water used. This can significantly affect the local water salinity levels, as opposed to the other options presented, which either have a protective aim (establishing as a national park), are neutral (sunken ships), or have a relatively minor local environmental impact (collecting marine animals)."
