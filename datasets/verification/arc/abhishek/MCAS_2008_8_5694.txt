Question: Which of the following statements best explains why the tilt of Earth on its axis causes summer to be warmer than winter in the Northern Hemisphere?
Options: ['The warm ocean currents flow from the tropics to the Northern Hemisphere in the summer.', 'The rays of the Sun strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly in the summer.', 'The greenhouse effect increases in the Northern Hemisphere in the summer.', 'The Northern Hemisphere is closer to the Sun in the summer.']
Answer: The rays of the Sun strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly in the summer.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The rays of the Sun strike the Northern Hemisphere more directly in the summer.",
    "reasoning": "The tilt of the Earth on its axis causes sunlight to be more direct in the Northern Hemisphere during summer, leading to higher temperatures. This is because the direct rays of the Sun provide more energy and warmth compared to when the Sun's rays are more oblique, which happens during winter. The concepts of 'Earth's axial tilt' and 'Sun rays' are directly related to this phenomenon, as they explain how and why the Northern Hemisphere experiences warmer temperatures in the summer."
