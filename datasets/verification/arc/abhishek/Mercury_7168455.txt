    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "precipitation",
    "reasoning": "Precipitation is directly responsible for returning water to the soil. During the water cycle, condensed water vapor forms clouds, which then release water in various forms of precipitation (like rain or snow). This precipitation falls to the ground, replenishing soil moisture levels and providing necessary water for terrestrial ecosystems. The relationship that explicitly outlines its direct impact on the soil is that precipitation 'nourishes' the soil."
