Model Answer: {
    "answer": "2 hydrogen, 1 oxygen",
    "reasoning": "A molecule of water is made up of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom, as defined by its chemical formula, H2O. This composition fits the definition and makeup of water, distinguishing it from other molecules by its specific atomic composition."
