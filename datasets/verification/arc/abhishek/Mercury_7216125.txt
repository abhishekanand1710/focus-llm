]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "limit diseases spread by contact",
    "reasoning": "The main purpose of placing hand sanitizer dispensers in classrooms and computer labs is to limit the spread of diseases by contact. Given that these are shared spaces where students are in close proximity and may use shared devices like computers, reducing transmission through hand contact is crucial. Hand sanitizers are specifically designed for this purpose, especially in environments where it's not always convenient to wash hands with soap and water immediately. This aligns with the general goal of maintaining a healthier environment for students by minimizing infectious agents that can be easily spread through touch."
