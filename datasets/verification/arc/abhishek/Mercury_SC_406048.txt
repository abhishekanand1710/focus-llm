Question: A student plants rosebushes in her front yard. The student is frequently seen pulling weeds from the base of the rosebushes. What is the most likely reason that the weeds are pulled?
Options: ['Weeds add fertilizer to the soil.', 'Weeds use nutrients the roses need to grow.', 'Weeds increase the bacteria in the soil.', 'Weeds consume most of the oxygen.']
Answer: Weeds use nutrients the roses need to grow.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Weeds use nutrients the roses need to grow.",
    "reasoning": "The relationship between weeds and rosebushes as competitors for nutrients in the soil is the primary reason for pulling weeds. Weeds consume the nutrients from the soil that are essential for the growth and maintenance of life in cultivated plants like roses. Therefore, to ensure the roses have enough nutrients to grow, it's necessary to remove the weeds that are competing for those same nutrients."
