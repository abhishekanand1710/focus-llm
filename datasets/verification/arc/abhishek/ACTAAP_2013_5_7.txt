Question: Sam builds a ramp and lets a toy car roll down. Which describes the energy of the car as it rolls down the ramp?
Options: ['The kinetic energy and the potential energy both increase.', 'The kinetic energy and the potential energy both decrease.', 'The kinetic energy increases and the potential energy decreases.', 'The kinetic energy decreases and the potential energy increases.']
Answer: The kinetic energy increases and the potential energy decreases.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The kinetic energy increases and the potential energy decreases.",
    "reasoning": "As the toy car rolls down the ramp, the gravitational potential energy it had at the higher position is converted into kinetic energy. This conversion occurs because its height above the ground (and thus its potential energy) decreases as it moves downward, while its speed (and thus its kinetic energy) increases. Therefore, the correct option is 'The kinetic energy increases and the potential energy decreases.'"
