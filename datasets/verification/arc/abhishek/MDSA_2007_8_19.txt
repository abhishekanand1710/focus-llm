Question: A toy car rolls at a constant speed down a straight inclined track. When the car reaches the flat surface at the base of the inclined track, the speed of the car decreases. Which statement best explains why the speed of the car decreases when it reaches the flat surface?
Options: ['The force of gravity acting on the car increases.', 'The force of gravity acting on the car decreases.', 'The forces influencing the car are not balanced.', 'The forces influencing the car are balanced.']
Answer: The forces influencing the car are not balanced.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The forces influencing the car are not balanced.",
    "reasoning": "When the toy car moves from the inclined track to the flat surface, it transitions from a state where gravity aids its motion to one where only friction and possibly air resistance act against its forward motion, with no component of gravity contributing to its forward velocity. This results in unbalanced forces acting on the toy car, primarily friction, which decelerates the car. The force of gravity does not suddenly increase or decrease due to the change in the angle of the surface, and the forces are clearly not balanced since the car experiences a change in velocity. Thus, the speed decreases due to unbalanced forces acting on the car."
