    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "amount of clay",
    "reasoning": "The amount of clay in soil is a crucial factor in determining its ability to retain nutrients. This is because clay particles are small and have a large surface area relative to their volume, allowing them to hold onto cations of essential nutrients that plants need to grow. In contrast, the amount of sand mainly affects drainage and aeration, texture is a broader characteristic that incorporates sand, silt, and clay content, and color, while it can indicate organic matter content, does not directly indicate nutrient content as effectively as the amount of clay does."
