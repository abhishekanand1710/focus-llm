    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "salt",
    "reasoning": "Unlike water, hydrogen gas, and carbon monoxide, which are composed of individual molecules, salt does not consist of individual molecules. Instead, it is made up of ions (anions and cations) that are arranged in a repeating pattern to form a crystalline structure. This ionic arrangement differs fundamentally from the discrete molecular structure seen in the other options."
