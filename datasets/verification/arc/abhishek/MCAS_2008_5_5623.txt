Question: The marsh willow herb is a plant native to the northeastern United States. It grows best in damp habitats. Which of the following environmental changes would most likely cause a decrease in the marsh willow herb population in an area?
Options: ['a rainstorm lasting several weeks', 'a drought lasting twelve months', 'unusually low temperatures during the month of July', 'unusually high temperatures during the month of January']
Answer: a drought lasting twelve months

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a drought lasting twelve months",
    "reasoning": "Based on the relationships identified, a drought lasting twelve months would directly reduce the moisture in habitats, which is critical for the survival and growth of the Marsh Willow Herb. Since this plant thrives in damp environments, a prolonged drought would significantly decrease its population by creating conditions unfavorable for its growth."
