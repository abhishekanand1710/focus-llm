Question: The concept of continental drift, continents drifting over the ocean floors, was proposed by Alfred Wegner in 1915. This concept was replaced by the theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s. Changes from the continental drift concept to the plate tectonics theory required which of the following?
Options: ['strong earthquakes occurring along fault zones', 'data and ideas being shared among scientists', 'a scientific law being passed by Congress', 'teachers beginning to teach the newer theory']
Answer: data and ideas being shared among scientists

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "data and ideas being shared among scientists",
    "reasoning": "The shift from the concept of Continental Drift to the theory of Plate Tectonics was significantly influenced by the accumulation and sharing of scientific data and ideas among the scientific community. This collaborative effort allowed for the refinement of initial hypotheses into more comprehensive and widely accepted theories, underscoring the importance of exchange in scientific progress. Unlike the other options, which are either too specific to a particular phenomenon (e.g., earthquakes) or not directly related to the process of scientific theory development (e.g., legislative action, education policy), the sharing of data and ideas directly impacts the evolution of scientific understanding and theories."
