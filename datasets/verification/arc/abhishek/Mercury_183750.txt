    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "rapid and profound climate change",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, 'rapid and profound climate change' presents a scenario where natural selection is most likely to occur because it requires species to adapt quickly to survive. Gradual changes offer more time for slow adaptations, while catastrophic and immediate loss scenarios may not allow enough time for evolutionary adaptations. Rapid climate changes apply immediate pressure on species for beneficial traits to prevail, making it a potent driver for natural selection."
