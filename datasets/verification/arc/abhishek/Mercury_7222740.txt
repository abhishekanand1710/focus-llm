Options: ['inner core and outer core', 'crust and inner core', 'crust and mantle', 'mantle and outer core']
Answer: crust and inner core

Model Response:
Concepts: [
    {
        "name": "Crust",
        "description": "The outermost layer of the Earth, composed of solid rock."
    },
    {

        "description": "The layer of the Earth between the crust and the outer core, composed of solid and partially melted rock."
    },
    {
        "name": "Outer Core",
        "description": "A layer of molten metal, mainly iron and nickel, surrounding the inner core of the Earth."
    },
    {
        "name": "Inner Core",
        "description": "The innermost part of the Earth, composed primarily of solid iron and nickel."
    }

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "crust and mantle",
    "reasoning": "The crust is the outermost layer of the Earth and is composed of solid rock, while the mantle is the layer beneath the crust, made of solid and partially melted rock, indicating it also contains a significant amount of solid material. While the inner core is indeed mostly solid, the outer core is liquid, not solid. Therefore, the layers of Earth mostly composed of solid material are the crust and mantle."
