Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Project image onto a piece of cardboard.",
    "reasoning": "Projecting the image of the Sun onto a piece of cardboard is a safe method for observing the Sun. It avoids direct eye exposure to the harmful solar radiation by observing a secondary source, the projected image. This technique is safe and effective and doesn't depend on the quality of equipment, their newness, or the time of day for observation, making it the best option among the given choices."
