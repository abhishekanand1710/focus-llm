]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "defend itself.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the identified concepts and their relationships, wasps primarily use their poison delivered through a stinger as a means of defense. The relationship between the wasp's use of poison and its stinger is directly related to its ability to defend itself, and not for producing eggs, building nests, or attracting mates. Therefore, the most accurate option is that a wasp uses poison in a stinger to defend itself."
