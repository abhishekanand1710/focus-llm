Question: One 7.0 kg bowling ball is lifted to a storage shelf 1.0 m above the floor. A second 7.0 kg ball is lifted to a storage shelf 2.0 m above the floor. Which of the following best explains why the measured force of gravity on each ball is nearly identical?
Options: ['The final potential energy of each ball increased.', 'The amount of work required to lift each ball is identical.', "The distance of each ball from Earth's center of mass is almost identical.", "The gravitational force of each ball on the other cancels out the force of Earth's gravity."]
Answer: The distance of each ball from Earth's center of mass is almost identical.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The distance of each ball from Earth's center of mass is almost identical.",
    "reasoning": "The force of gravity on each ball is nearly identical because their distances from Earth's center of mass are almost the same. Changes in height such as 1.0 m or 2.0 m are negligible compared to the Earth's radius, meaning the gravitational force exerted by the Earth on each ball remains nearly constant. Other factors, such as the work done to lift them or their potential energy, do not directly affect the measured gravitational force itself."
