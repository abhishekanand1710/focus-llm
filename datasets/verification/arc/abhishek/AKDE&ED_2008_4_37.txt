Model Answer: {
    "answer": "increased number of trees cut down.",
    "reasoning": "The invention and use of paper directly contributes to an increased number of trees being cut down, as the production of paper involves converting wood into pulp. This process has historically led to deforestation, as more trees are harvested to meet the demand for paper products."
