Question: Limestone is a sedimentary rock and marble is a metamorphic rock. Even though limestone and marble have the same chemical makeup, they are classified as different rocks because they
Options: ['were formed from different fossils', 'took different amounts of time to form', 'formed at different times', 'formed by different methods']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "formed by different methods",
    "reasoning": "Even though Limestone and Marble have the same chemical makeup, they are classified as different types of rocks because their formation processes are fundamentally different. Limestone is formed through sedimentation - the accumulation and compaction of mineral and organic particles on the ocean floor or other bodies of water. Marble, on the other hand, is formed by the metamorphism of limestone, where under the influence of high pressure and temperature, limestone's structure and composition are changed to form marble. Thus, the distinguishing factor between them is the method by which they are formed."
