Question: All of the following are examples of erosion EXCEPT:
Options: ['The wind in the desert blows sand against a rock.', 'A glacier picks up boulders as it moves.', 'A flood washes over a riverbank, and the water carries small soil particles downstream.', 'An icy winter causes the pavement in a road to crack.']
Answer: An icy winter causes the pavement in a road to crack.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "An icy winter causes the pavement in a road to crack.",
    "reasoning": "The cracking of pavement in a road due to an icy winter is a result of thermal expansion, not erosion. While the other options describe processes directly involving the movement or displacement of natural materials (i.e., soil, rock, sand) by natural forces such as wind, glacial movement, or water flow, thermal expansion involves a change in material volume in response to temperature changes. Cracking pavement does not fit the definition of erosion, making it the correct answer."
