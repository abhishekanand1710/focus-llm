    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "oceans",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, oceans have the greatest capacity for storing thermal energy from the Sun. This is because they cover about 71% of Earth's surface, allowing them to absorb a significant amount of solar energy. Additionally, the physical properties of water enable it to store this energy more efficiently compared to air, land, or plants. Water has a high heat capacity, meaning it can absorb a lot of heat before it begins to get hot, making the oceans an immense thermal energy reservoir."
