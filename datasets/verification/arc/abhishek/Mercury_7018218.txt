Key: Mercury_7018218

Question: The majority of the fresh water on Earth is frozen in glaciers and ice caps. If the climate changed around the world, causing glaciers and ice caps to melt, which situation would most likely occur?
Options: ['Land would become more fertile.', 'Air temperatures would decrease.', 'Ocean water would become saltier.', 'Land masses would become smaller.']
Answer: Land masses would become smaller.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Land masses would become smaller.",
    "reasoning": "The melting of glaciers and ice caps, caused by climate change, adds significant amounts of fresh water to the oceans. This results in a rise in sea level, which would submerge coastal regions and reduce the size of land masses. The concepts and relationships identified demonstrate how the dynamics of fresh water sources, climate change, and increasing ocean levels are interconnected, leading to the conclusion that land masses would indeed become smaller as a consequence of such environmental changes."
