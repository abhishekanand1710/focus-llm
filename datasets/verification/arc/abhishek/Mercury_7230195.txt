Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Their structures differentiated into distinct layers.",
    "reasoning": "During the planetary formation process, the heating of the planets leads to the melting and differentiation of their materials according to density. This process, known as structural differentiation, results in the development of distinct layers within the planets. This direct causal relationship between heating during formation and structural differentiation, among the given options, best explains the change resulting from the heating of the planets as they formed."
