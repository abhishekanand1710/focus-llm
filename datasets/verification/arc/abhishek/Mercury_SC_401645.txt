Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Sleeping on a chair",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, 'Sleeping on a chair' is an acquired trait that results from environmental influences. Kittens do not innately prefer specific sleeping spots like chairs; instead, they learn this behavior based on their surroundings and experiences, making it an acquired trait. Other options such as cleaning its ears and sharpening its claws are instinctual behaviors for self-maintenance and survival, while meowing when hungry is a form of communication that can be both instinctual and influenced by environmental factors. However, the specific choice of sleeping on a chair is more directly tied to environmental influences and experiences."
