    {
        "name": "compaction",
        "description": "The process that presses sediments together, reducing their volume and making them more solid."

        "related_concept": "cementation",
        "description": "After sediments are compacted, they may undergo cementation to bind together and form solid rock."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "erosion",
    "reasoning": "The formation of sedimentary rocks begins with erosion, where natural forces like water, wind, and ice wear down and move rock and soil from one place to another. This first step is crucial for providing the materials that will eventually become sedimentary rocks through the subsequent processes of deposition, compaction, and cementation."
