Model Answer: {
    "answer": "flowers",
    "reasoning": "An apple tree starts to grow apples after it has produced flowers. These flowers, once pollinated, will develop into fruits (apples), which contain the seeds. Therefore, the presence of flowers on an apple tree is a sign that the tree is going to start growing apples."
}
