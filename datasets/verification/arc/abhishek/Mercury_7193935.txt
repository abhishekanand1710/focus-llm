Question: Astronomers and biologists study different areas of science. Many astronomers observe far distant objects in the sky. Many biologists study extremely small objects. What do these astronomers and biologists have most in common?
Options: ['They both examine the history of life on Earth.', 'They both make discoveries using optical devices.', 'They both study how organisms change over time.', 'They both search for evidence about the origins of the universe.']
Answer: They both make discoveries using optical devices.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They both make discoveries using optical devices.",
    "reasoning": "Both astronomers and biologists heavily rely on optical devices for their research. Astronomers use telescopes to observe distant celestial bodies, while biologists use microscopes to study minuscule organisms or cellular structures. Despite the vast differences in the scale and focus of their studies, the common tool across both disciplines - optical devices - is crucial for their ability to make discoveries."
