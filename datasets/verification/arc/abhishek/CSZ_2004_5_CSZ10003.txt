Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Are cats more active at night than during the day?.",
    "reasoning": "The question about whether cats are more active at night than during the day is testable through scientific investigation. This can be empirically tested by observing and recording the activity levels of cats during different times over a period. Unlike the other options, which involve subjective judgments or cannot be directly measured, the activity patterns of cats can be objectively measured, making it a suitable question for scientific investigation."
