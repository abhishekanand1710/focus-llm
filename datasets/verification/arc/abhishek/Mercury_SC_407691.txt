Key: Mercury_SC_407691

Question: Felicia noticed how air temperatures were cooler and there were fewer hours of daylight during some of the seasons. Which of the following contributes to these seasonal changes?
Options: ['Earth rotates on its axis.', 'Earth revolves around the Sun.', 'The Sun has less energy in winter.', 'The Sun moves further from Earth in winter.']
Answer: Earth revolves around the Sun.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Earth revolves around the Sun.",
    "reasoning": "Seasonal changes, including variations in temperature and daylight hours, are primarily caused by Earth's revolution around the Sun, combined with its axial tilt. This orbital path and axial position result in different parts of the Earth receiving varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year, which leads to the seasons. Unlike the incorrect notions that the Sun's energy varies significantly with seasons or that the Sun's relative distance from Earth drastically changes throughout the year, it is the angle of sunlight and the distribution of sunlight hours caused by Earth's revolution and axial tilt that are responsible for seasonal changes."
