Model Answer: {
    "answer": "blizzard",
    "reasoning": "A blizzard is the only event among the options that is specifically characterized by heavy precipitation (as snow), strong winds, and typically occurs when surface air temperatures are below 0\u00b0C. Hurricanes, though involving heavy precipitation and strong winds, occur in tropical environments with warmer temperatures. Thunderstorms and tornadoes can involve strong winds and precipitation but are not required to have temperatures below 0\u00b0C."
