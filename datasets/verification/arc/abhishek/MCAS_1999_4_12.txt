    },
    {
        "name": "star",
        "description": "A massive celestial body that emits light and heat from nuclear fusion reactions in its core."
    },

        "name": "moon",

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "star",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, a star is a source of light, generating its own light and heat through nuclear fusion in its core. Earth and the moon do not generate their own light; they reflect light from the stars, specifically the Sun. While 'planet' is a more general term and includes bodies that do not emit light on their own but rather reflect it."
