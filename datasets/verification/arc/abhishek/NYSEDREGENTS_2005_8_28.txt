Model Answer: {
    "answer": "break down foods for absorption into the blood",
    "reasoning": "The primary function of the human digestive system is to break down foods into smaller molecules that can be absorbed into the blood, providing essential nutrients to the body. This function aligns with the concept of 'Absorption,' which indicates the process through which nutrients from foods are taken into the body's internal environment. This action facilitates the distribution of nutrients by the blood to various parts of the body, distinguishing it from other options which describe functions of the respiratory system (exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide), cellular processes (release of energy from sugars), and the circulatory system's role (carrying nutrients to all parts of the body)."
