Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It turns from saltwater to freshwater.",
    "reasoning": "In the water cycle, when water moves from oceans (saltwater) to clouds, the process of evaporation is involved. During evaporation, only the water molecules are converted into vapor and rise into the atmosphere, leaving the salts and minerals behind in the ocean. This results in the formation of freshwater vapor in the clouds, as evaporation does not carry the salt particles from the ocean into the atmosphere. Thus, the change in the water involves turning from saltwater to freshwater."
