Model Answer: {
    "answer": "rivers",
    "reasoning": "From the concepts and relationships identified, rivers are the primary natural force that can form both valleys and canyons through the process of erosion and carving. Glaciers also play a significant role in shaping these landscapes but are more specific to colder climates and are less universally applicable than rivers in the formation of both valleys and canyons. Wind and tides contribute to the shaping of such landscapes but do not have as direct and widespread an impact on the formation of both valleys and canyons as rivers do."
