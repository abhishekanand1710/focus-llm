Question: Many communities in the United States use coal to produce electricity. One problem with using coal is that
Options: ['very little energy is produced.', 'ecosystems can be damaged.', 'it contains harmful bacteria.', 'it is a very rare resource.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ecosystems can be damaged.",
    "reasoning": "The mining and burning of coal for electricity production can lead to the release of pollutants and disruption of land, which can damage ecosystems. This is directly related to the adverse environmental impacts of coal usage. Unlike the other options, this consequence of using coal is well-documented and widely recognized."
