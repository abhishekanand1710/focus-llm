Options: ['must be solid.', 'could be either solid or liquid.', 'must be liquid.', 'could be either liquid or gas.']
Answer: could be either solid or liquid.

        "related_concept": "gas",
        "description": "Gases do not have a fixed volume in standard conditions; they expand to fill their container."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "could be either solid or liquid.",
    "reasoning": "Given the sample has a fixed volume and assumes a cylindrical shape matching its container, it could be either a solid (if it was formed or manufactured in that specific shape) or a liquid (which naturally takes the shape of its container). Gases cannot maintain a fixed volume without external constraints and would not adopt the container's shape in the manner described."
