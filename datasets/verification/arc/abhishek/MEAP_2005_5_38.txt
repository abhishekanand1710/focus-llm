Key: MEAP_2005_5_38

Question: As an airplane climbs in the sky, the pilot notices ice crystals forming on the windshield. This happens because
Options: ['blizzards occur more often at higher altitudes.', 'friction with the atmosphere causes ice to develop.', 'water evaporates faster at higher altitudes, resulting in ice crystals.', 'moisture on the outside of the plane freezes due to colder air at higher altitudes.']
Answer: moisture on the outside of the plane freezes due to colder air at higher altitudes.

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "moisture on the outside of the plane freezes due to colder air at higher altitudes.",
    "reasoning": "As an airplane climbs, it reaches higher altitudes where the air is colder. This decrease in temperature causes the moisture present in the air around the airplane to freeze, leading to ice crystals forming on surfaces such as the windshield. The other options do not accurately describe the mechanism by which ice forms in this scenario."
