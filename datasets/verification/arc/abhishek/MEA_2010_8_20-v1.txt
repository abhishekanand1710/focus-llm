    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Earth's tides decrease in size.",
    "reasoning": "As the Moon moves away from Earth, the gravitational pull it exerts on Earth decreases. This reduction in gravitational pull would result in smaller tides on Earth, because the magnitude of tidal forces is directly related to the distance between the Earth and the Moon. The other options are not directly affected in the manner described by the Moon moving away from Earth."
