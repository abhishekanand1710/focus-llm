Question: Earth's distance from the Sun helps the planet sustain life. If the Sun were larger, what would most likely also have to be true for Earth to sustain life?
Options: ['Earth would have to be further from the Sun.', 'Earth would have to be closer to the Sun.', 'Earth would have to be smaller.', 'Earth would have to be larger.']
Answer: Earth would have to be further from the Sun.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Earth would have to be further from the Sun.",
    "reasoning": "If the Sun were larger, it would emit more energy and thus increase the temperature of Earth if it remained at the same distance. To maintain a climate that is conducive to life, Earth would need to be in the adjusted Habitable Zone, which would be further from a larger Sun to keep its surface temperature within a range that supports life."
