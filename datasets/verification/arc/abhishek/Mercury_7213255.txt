Key: Mercury_7213255

Question: Four students compared the total mass of the products to the total mass of the reactants after performing three trials of the same chemical reaction. Each student concluded that the total mass of the products was slightly less than the total mass of the reactants. Each student proposed a different explanation as follows. Student 1: The reaction converted some of the reactant mass to energy. Student 2: The chemical reaction produced a gas that escaped. Student 3: Some of the mass measurements were made with insufficient precision. Student 4: Heat released during the reaction caused the volume of the products to increase.Which students offered the most reasonable explanations?
Options: ['Students 1 and 3', 'Students 1 and 4', 'Students 2 and 3', 'Students 2 and 4']

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Students 2 and 3",
    "reasoning": "The Law of Conservation of Mass dictates that the mass remains constant in a closed system undergoing a chemical reaction, challenging Student 1's explanation. The expansion of volume due to heat (Student 4's proposal) affects volume rather than mass. Therefore, the escape of gases (Student 2) and inaccuracies in measurement precision (Student 3) offer the most plausible explanations for observing a decrease in mass, complying with real-world principles of chemistry."
