Question: Researchers recently discovered a gene in humans that previously was unknown to science. Which statement best explains why the gene probably was not discovered much sooner?
Options: ['The gene only recently evolved in humans.', 'The technology used to study genes is still being developed.', 'Scientists were not interested in genes until a few years ago.', 'Scientists were sure they had already discovered every possible gene.']
Answer: The technology used to study genes is still being developed.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The technology used to study genes is still being developed.",
    "reasoning": "The discovery of a previously unknown gene in humans can most logically be attributed to advancements in genetic technology. This field is continuously evolving, offering new methodologies and tools for deeper exploration of the human genome. Unlike the options suggesting human evolution or lack of scientific interest, which are either improbable or incorrect considering the long-standing and intense focus on genetics, or the belief that all genes have been discovered, which does not reflect the ever-expanding understanding in the field, the development of genetic technology provides a practical explanation for why the gene was not discovered sooner."
