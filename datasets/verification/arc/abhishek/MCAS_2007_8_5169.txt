Model Answer: {
    "answer": "sugar crystals dissolving in water",
    "reasoning": "Sugar crystals dissolving in water is an example of the formation of a mixture because the sugar and water combine without creating a new chemical substance. Each substance (sugar and water) retains its chemical identity, aligning with the definition of a mixture. The other options describe chemical reactions where new substances are formed, which does not fit the criteria for a mixture."
