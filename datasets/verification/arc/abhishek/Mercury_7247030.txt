Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a decrease in the availability of food",
    "reasoning": "When large floods occur, they can significantly disrupt the island habitat where endangered parrots live. This includes destroying the vegetation and insects that serve as food sources for these parrots. Without access to their necessary sustenance, the parrot population could face a negative impact due to starvation or forced migration in search of food."
