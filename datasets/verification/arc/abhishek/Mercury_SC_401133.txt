Question: What should be done when the results of an experiment do not support the hypothesis?
Options: ['repeat the experiment and check for errors', 'change the observations to match the hypothesis', 'redo the experiment until the expected results are obtained', 'record and analyze the data after changing the hypothesis']
Answer: repeat the experiment and check for errors

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "repeat the experiment and check for errors",
    "reasoning": "When the results of an experiment do not support the hypothesis, researchers should repeat the experiment to confirm the validity of the results and check for errors that could have led to unexpected outcomes. This approach aligns with the scientific method, which values reproducibility and accurate data collection. Changing observations or the hypothesis to fit preconceived notions undermines the integrity of scientific inquiry. Continued iteration and examination of the experiment and hypothesis based on objective observations will lead to a more accurate understanding of the natural world."
