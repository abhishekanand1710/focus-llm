Question: How will a thriving grassland ecosystem most likely be affected by a drought?
Options: ['Plant respiration will increase.', 'Animals will be forced to migrate.', 'Soil nutrients will be enriched.', 'Natural succession will cease.']
Answer: Animals will be forced to migrate.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Animals will be forced to migrate.",
    "reasoning": "During a drought, water and food resources become scarce in grassland ecosystems. This scarcity leads animals to migrate in search of new habitats with adequate resources, making 'Animals will be forced to migrate.' the most likely outcome among the provided options."
