Model Answer: {
    "answer": "flammability",
    "reasoning": "Flammability is a chemical property of matter because it describes a substance's ability to burn or ignite, which can only be observed during a chemical reaction. Unlike density, boiling point, and shape, which are physical properties and describe the physical characteristics of a substance without altering its chemical composition, flammability directly relates to how a substance chemically reacts with oxygen (combustion)."
