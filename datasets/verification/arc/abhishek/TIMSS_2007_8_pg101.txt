Question: Sugar is made up of many molecules. When sugar is dissolved in water, what happens to these molecules?
Options: ['They no longer exist.', 'They exist in solution.', 'They evaporate.', 'They combine with water to form new elements.']
Answer: They exist in solution.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They exist in solution.",
    "reasoning": "When sugar is dissolved in water, its molecules disperse throughout the water, creating a solution. This is because sugar molecules separate and are surrounded by water molecules but do not change their chemical composition or evaporate. They remain in the solution as sugar molecules, and no new elements are formed in this process."
