    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "cells",
    "reasoning": "The fundamental difference between living and nonliving things mentioned in the options is that living things are comprised of cells. Cells serve as the basic unit of life, essential for the numerous characteristics that define living organisms, such as metabolism, growth, and the ability to reproduce, which nonliving things do not possess. While compounds, elements, and molecules can be found in both living and nonliving things, only living things have cells."
