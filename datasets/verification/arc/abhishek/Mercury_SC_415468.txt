Model Answer: {
    "answer": "otters",
    "reasoning": "Based on the relationships identified, otters are the animals that would most likely thrive in a flooding environment. Flooding increases water habitat areas, which benefits aquatic animals like otters by providing them with expanded areas for hunting and living. Unlike the other animals listed, otters are adapted to life in water, making them the best suited to thrive in the conditions caused by heavy rains leading to flooding in a valley."
