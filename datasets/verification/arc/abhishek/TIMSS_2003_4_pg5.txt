Model Answer: {
    "answer": "iron nails and aluminum nails.",
    "reasoning": "A strong magnet can separate a mixture of iron nails and aluminum nails because iron nails are made of ferromagnetic material which is attracted to magnets, while aluminum nails are made of non-ferromagnetic material and will not be attracted. This property allows for the separation based on magnetic attraction."
