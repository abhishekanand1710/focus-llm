Question: Humus is an organic material that makes up soil. Which characteristic best indicates that soil has a high humus content?
Options: ['the color of the sample', 'the mass of the sample', 'the amount of clay in the sample', 'the amount of rock in the sample']
Answer: the color of the sample

Model Response:

        "description": "High humus content typically darkens the soil, indicating richer organic material content."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the color of the sample",
    "reasoning": "Among the options given, 'the color of the sample' is the best indicator of high humus content in soil. This is because humus, being dark organic material, significantly darkens the soil, indicating a richer presence of organic matter. This relationship between humus content and soil color is well-documented; darker soils are often richer in humus and thus more fertile. Other options such as the mass of the sample, the amount of clay, or the amount of rock, while important, do not specifically indicate the presence of humus as directly as the color of the soil does."
