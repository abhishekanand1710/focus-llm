Question: Two flowers are both roses. One rose is larger and has more fragrance than the other rose. What advantage will one of the roses most likely gain because of this difference?
Options: ['The larger rose will have fewer petals than the smaller rose.', 'The larger rose will more easily attract bees than the smaller rose.', 'The smaller rose will have more pollen than the larger rose.', 'The smaller rose will grow faster than the larger rose.']
Answer: The larger rose will more easily attract bees than the smaller rose.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The larger rose will more easily attract bees than the smaller rose.",
    "reasoning": "Given that one rose is larger and emits more fragrance than the other, it is likely to have an advantage in attracting bees due to its strong scent and possibly greater visual presence. Bees are attracted to flowers by both their appearance and their fragrance, as these insects play a significant role in the process of pollination. Since the larger rose has a stronger fragrance, it will more effectively allure bees for the purpose of pollination compared to the smaller, less fragrant rose."
