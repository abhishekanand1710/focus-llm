Model Answer: {
    "answer": "two valence electrons.",
    "reasoning": "Alkaline earth metals, being in the same family in the periodic table, share common properties including their electron configuration. They are characterized by having two valence electrons, which explains their placement in Group 2 of the periodic table and their similar chemical behaviors."
