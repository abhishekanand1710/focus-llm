Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a river",
    "reasoning": "Comparing the options provided, 'a mushroom', 'a tree', and 'a worm' are all living things, classified respectively in the kingdoms of Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia as living organisms. 'A river', however, is a nonliving thing as it is essentially a natural water course and does not exhibit characteristics of life such as growth, reproduction, or cellular structure. Thus, 'a river' is the correct answer among the given options."
