Question: The classification of some organisms has changed. Which new process is used to reclassify organisms?
Options: ['Organisms are now given Latin-based scientific names.', 'Structures are now examined at the molecular level.', 'Organisms are now divided into three kingdoms.', 'Structures are now used to classify organisms.']
Answer: Structures are now examined at the molecular level.

Model Response:
Concepts: [
    {
        "name": "Latin-based scientific names",
        "description": "A system of nomenclature in which organisms are given unique, universally accepted Latin names."
    },
    {
        "name": "Molecular level examination",
        "description": "A process that involves studying the molecular composition and structure of organisms to understand their classification and relationships."
    },
    {
        "name": "Three kingdoms classification",
        "description": "An earlier biological classification system that divided organisms into three groups: Animalia, Plantae, and Minerals."
    },
    {
        "name": "Structural classification",
        "description": "A method of classifying organisms based on their physical and anatomical structures."
    }
]

Relationships: [

        "concept": "Latin-based scientific names",
        "relationship": "is a method of",
        "related_concept": "Structural classification",
        "description": "Latin-based scientific names are a result of structural classification, providing unique identification."
    },

        "relationship": "is used for",
        "related_concept": "reclassifying organisms",
        "description": "The molecular level examination is a key process in the reclassification of organisms, reflecting evolutionary relationships."
    },
    {
        "concept": "Three kingdoms classification",
        "relationship": "is outdated by",
        "related_concept": "Molecular level examination",
        "description": "The three kingdoms classification system has been surpassed by systems that rely on molecular level examination."
    },
    {
        "concept": "Structural classification",
        "relationship": "is enhanced by",
        "related_concept": "Molecular level examination",
        "description": "Structural classification is now often supplemented with molecular data to provide a more accurate classification."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Structures are now examined at the molecular level.",
    "reasoning": "The process of examining structures at the molecular level is essential for the accurate classification and reclassification of organisms. This method reflects evolutionary relationships more precisely than structural classification alone, and has thus led to changes in how organisms are classified, making it the correct option among the given choices."
