Question: A scientist conducts an experiment on the growth rate of a specific species of plant. Which of these is needed for the data to be relied upon by other scientists?
Options: ['The investigation must use many variables.', 'Equipment used in the investigation must be new.', 'Results of the investigation must be recorded accurately.', 'The investigation needs to be performed by well-known scientists.']
Answer: Results of the investigation must be recorded accurately.

]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Results of the investigation must be recorded accurately.",
    "reasoning": "Among the presented options, the accuracy of data recording is fundamental for the reliability of scientific findings. This is because accurate data ensure that the findings can be reproduced and verified by other scientists, fulfilling the essence of scientific research. Controlling many variables is part of experimental design but not necessary for reliability per se. The novelty of equipment may affect precision but doesn't inherently make data reliable. Lastly, the reputation of the scientists conducting the research has no bearing on the empirical reliability of the results."
