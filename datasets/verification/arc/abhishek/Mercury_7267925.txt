Model Answer: {
    "answer": "intense sunlight.",
    "reasoning": "The outer layers of astronauts' space suits are made of reflective material specifically to protect them from intense sunlight. This material reflects solar radiation, including harmful ultraviolet and infrared radiation, thus reducing the heat absorbed by the suit and protecting the astronaut. This relationship showcases the direct purpose of the reflective outer layers in protecting against the sun's radiation, distinguishing it from the suit's other protective measures against vacuum, micrometeoroids, and water loss."
