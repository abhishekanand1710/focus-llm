Question: A change in the density of air can result in a breeze. Which diagram best shows a series of energy transfers that begins with the Sun and results in a breeze?
Options: ['radiation → conduction → breeze', 'radiation → conduction → convection → breeze', 'convection → radiation → breeze', 'convection → conduction → radiation → breeze']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "radiation \u2192 conduction \u2192 convection \u2192 breeze",
    "reasoning": "The process begins with the Sun emitting radiation, which transfers energy to the Earth's surface primarily through radiation. Once the Earth's surface is heated, it conducts heat to the air immediately above it, causing the air to warm up. This warm air then rises, and cooler air moves in to replace it\u2014a process known as convection. These movements of air due to differences in temperature and thus density result in breezes. The direct path from radiation to the creation of a breeze involves conduction (as heat transfer to the air) and then convection (as the movement of air), resulting in the correct sequence: 'radiation \u2192 conduction \u2192 convection \u2192 breeze'."
