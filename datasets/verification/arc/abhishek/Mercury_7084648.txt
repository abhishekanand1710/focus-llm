Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Great distance from the ocean.",
    "reasoning": "Nevada's significantly low annual rainfall is primarily due to its large distance from the ocean. This geographic separation means that moist air masses from the ocean have less influence over the area's climate, leading to lower humidity and, consequently, reduced precipitation. Although factors like high elevations and the presence of deserts also play a role in determining regional climate and moisture levels, the fundamental reason for the lack of rainfall in Nevada is its considerable distance from large bodies of water that could provide moisture."
