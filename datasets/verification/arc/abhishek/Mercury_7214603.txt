Model Answer: {
    "answer": "12",
    "reasoning": "The Moon completes a revolution around the Earth approximately once every month. Given there are about 12 months in a year, the Moon revolves around the Earth approximately 12 times during one revolution of Earth around the Sun. This reasoning aligns with the concepts of orbits and revolutions, where the Earth's orbit around the Sun takes one year, while the Moon's orbit around the Earth fits within a month, amounting to about 12 revolutions of the Moon around the Earth in the time it takes the Earth to orbit the Sun once."
