Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Airplanes can travel very quickly.",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, the benefit of airplanes is their capability to travel at high speeds compared to other modes of transportation. This is enabled by their design and the technology used, making long-distance travel much faster and more efficient. The other options, such as their cost, the requirement to take off from an airport, and the challenge in flying them, do not represent benefits but rather operational aspects or challenges associated with air travel."
