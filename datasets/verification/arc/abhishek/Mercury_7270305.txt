Question: Many horses grow a heavy coat in autumn and shed that coat in spring. Scientists were not sure if temperature or the amount of daylight per day (called the photoperiod) caused the change. So, they conducted an experiment and concluded that the change in photoperiod was responsible for the biological changes. Shedding caused by which set of conditions would have helped them arrive at this conclusion?
Options: ['a constant photoperiod, but varied temperatures', 'a varied photoperiod, and varied temperatures', 'a constant photoperiod, and a constant temperature', 'a varied photoperiod, but a constant temperature']
Answer: a varied photoperiod, but a constant temperature

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a varied photoperiod, but a constant temperature",
    "reasoning": "The conclusion that photoperiod (and not temperature) causes the shedding and growth of coats in horses would most likely be drawn from an experimental setup where the photoperiod varies while the temperature is kept constant. This setup isolates the photoperiod as the variable causing the change, as changes in the horses' coats would occur irrespective of the temperature if photoperiod is the main driver for shedding. This option directly tests the effect of photoperiod on biological changes while eliminating temperature as a variable factor."
