Question: A small ice cube at a temperature of 0°C is dropped into a glass of water at 28°C and melts. What is the temperature of the water in the glass just after the ice cube melts?
Options: ['0°C', 'between 0°C and 28°C', '28°C', 'greater than 28°C']
Answer: between 0°C and 28°C

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "between 0\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C",
    "reasoning": "When the ice cube is dropped into the water, heat transfers from the warmer water (28\u00b0C) to the cooler ice (0\u00b0C), causing the ice to melt. The process of melting absorbs heat from the water without raising the temperature of the ice itself, but rather changing its state from solid to liquid. This results in the water's temperature decreasing as it loses thermal energy to the ice. Since the system moves towards equilibrium, but the melting ice cannot reach temperatures above 0\u00b0C until fully melted, and the water started at 28\u00b0C, the final temperature must logically fall between 0\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C after the ice has melted and reached thermal equilibrium with the water. The exact final temperature would depend on the masses of the ice and water and their specific heat capacities, but without that information, it's clear it has to be between the start temperatures of the ice and water."
