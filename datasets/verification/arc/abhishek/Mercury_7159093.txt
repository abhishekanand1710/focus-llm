Question: A female opossum can give birth to 5-15 offspring. What increases with a larger litter?
Options: ['the rate at which they mature', 'the number of reliable food sources', 'the amount of maternal care per offspring', 'the likelihood that some will survive and reproduce']
Answer: the likelihood that some will survive and reproduce

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the likelihood that some will survive and reproduce",
    "reasoning": "With a larger litter size, while the amount of maternal care per offspring may decrease, the statistical likelihood that at least some of the offspring will survive to adulthood and consequently reproduce increases. This is because with more offspring, the chances of at least a few managing to navigate the challenges of growth and survival improve, even if individual care from the mother may be less due to the need to divide attention among more offspring."
