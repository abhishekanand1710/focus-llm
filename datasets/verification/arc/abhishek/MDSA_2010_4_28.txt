Model Answer: {
    "answer": "a consumer",
    "reasoning": "Humans consume both corn and peas, which are seeds from plants, making them consumers in the food web. As consumers, they rely on producers (such as corn and peas) for nourishment, rather than producing energy themselves (like producers) or breaking down dead organic material (like decomposers). Scavengers consume dead animals or plants, which does not directly apply to the consumption of living plant seeds by humans."
