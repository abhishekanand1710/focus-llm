Key: Mercury_7217963

Question: Due to the increasing average temperature of the atmosphere, polar ice sheets melt at a greater rate than they form. Which of these will be an effect of the continued melting of polar ice?
Options: ['A major reservoir of fresh water will decrease.', 'Plant life will increase due to higher sea levels.', 'Water runoff will cause an increase in ocean salinity.', 'Ocean temperature will decrease with the addition of cold water.']
Answer: A major reservoir of fresh water will decrease.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "A major reservoir of fresh water will decrease.",
    "reasoning": "As the polar ice sheets melt at a greater rate due to the increased average temperature of the atmosphere, these ice sheets, which are significant reservoirs of fresh water, decrease in size. This is a direct outcome of the accelerated melting rate decreasing the total amount of fresh water trapped in ice form at the poles. Other options do not directly relate to the primary effects of polar ice melting on global water systems as strongly as the decrease in fresh water reserves."
