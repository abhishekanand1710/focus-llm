Question: Which best describes the speed of a ball as it is thrown straight up into the air and comes back down?
Options: ['The ball goes up at a constant speed, stops, then comes down at a constant speed.', 'The ball goes up at a constant speed, stops, and increases speed as it comes down.', 'The ball goes slower and slower as it goes up, stops, and then goes faster and faster as it comes down.', 'The ball goes slower and slower as it goes up, stops, and then comes down at a constant speed.']
Answer: The ball goes slower and slower as it goes up, stops, and then goes faster and faster as it comes down.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The ball goes slower and slower as it goes up, stops, and then goes faster and faster as it comes down.",
    "reasoning": "As a ball is thrown upwards, gravitational force acts against its motion, slowing it down until it momentarily stops at its peak height. Then, as it falls, acceleration due to gravity increases its speed, causing it to move faster as it approaches the ground. This process affects the ball's velocity, showing a deceleration followed by an acceleration in the direction of gravity."
