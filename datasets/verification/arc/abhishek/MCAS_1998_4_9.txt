Question: For his science project, Alan began a study of sugar maple trees. He noticed many differences among the sugar maple trees near his school. Which of the following three characteristics would vary the LEAST?
Options: ['height', 'number of leaves', 'type of seeds', 'trunk width']
Answer: type of seeds

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "type of seeds",
    "reasoning": "Among the characteristics listed, 'type of seeds' would vary the least because sugar maple trees, being of the same species, generally produce a very similar type of seed (samaras) with only minor variations, if any. Height, number of leaves, and trunk width are all characteristics subject to significant variability based on environmental factors, age, and individual health of the trees. Therefore, while the basic seed structure remains consistent across sugar maples, properties such as height, leaf count, and trunk width are more prone to variation."
