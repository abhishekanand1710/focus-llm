Question: Chris left a glass of water on a windowsill. When he looked at the glass a few days later, some of the water had evaporated. Which of the following best describes what happened to the particles of water that evaporated?
Options: ['They became larger in size.', 'They spread out into the air.', 'They were absorbed by the glass.', 'They passed through the glass into the air.']
Answer: They spread out into the air.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "They spread out into the air.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the concepts identified and their relationships, when water evaporates, the process involves the water particles changing from a liquid state to a vapor state due to evaporation. These particles then mix with the air surrounding the glass of water. The particles do not become larger, are not absorbed by the glass, nor do they pass through the glass. Therefore, the best description of what happens to the particles of water that evaporated is that they spread out into the air."
