Question: In early 2003, the Human Genome Project identified the sequence of base pairs in the genes in human DNA. With all of this information, many of the functions of the genes are still unknown. Currently, scientists are studying many of these genes in order to learn more about them. What is the significance of this new genetic discovery?
Options: ['It can provide new methods for creating diseases.', 'It can lead to faster chromosome replication.', 'It can lead to a simpler structure for DNA.', 'It can provide new ways to treat diseases.']
Answer: It can provide new ways to treat diseases.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It can provide new ways to treat diseases.",
    "reasoning": "The identification and ongoing study of the sequence of base pairs and the functions of genes, as achieved by the Human Genome Project, open up new possibilities for treating diseases. By understanding the genetic basis of diseases, scientists can develop targeted treatments that are more effective and have fewer side effects. Therefore, the most significant impact of this discovery is its potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing new ways to treat diseases."
