Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Energy for cell processes is released.",
    "reasoning": "The fundamental outcome of cellular respiration is the conversion of nutrients into ATP, which is the energy currency used for various cellular processes. This metabolic process utilizes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, water, and ATP. Unlike photosynthesis, which produces oxygen and requires light, cellular respiration releases energy stored in the bonds of glucose molecules. This is distinct from other options as cellular respiration does not directly result in oxygen release for photosynthesis, decomposition of cells, or the excretion of nutrients to prevent body fat buildup. Instead, the primary and direct consequence is the release of usable energy for the cell."
