Question: The heart is the major organ of the circulatory system. Which part of the body is responsible for delivering de-oxygenated blood to the heart?
Options: ['arteries', 'capillaries', 'valves', 'veins']

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "veins",
    "reasoning": "Veins are identified as the blood vessels responsible for carrying de-oxygenated blood back to the heart, which directly addresses the query regarding which part of the body is accountable for delivering de-oxygenated blood to the heart. This function contrasts with arteries, which carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, capillaries, which serve as sites of gas exchange, and valves, which regulate blood flow."
