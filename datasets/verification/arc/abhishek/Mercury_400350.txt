Model Answer: {
    "answer": "contracting muscles",
    "reasoning": "Among the options, contracting muscles is not an example of a negative feedback mechanism. While muscle contraction is crucial for movement and various bodily functions, it is not directly involved in the regulatory feedback processes that maintain homeostasis, such as regulating blood pressure, body temperature, or blood sugar levels, which are classic examples of negative feedback mechanisms."
