Question: Rat snakes, Elaphe obsoleta, are a species made of many distinct populations in different areas. Each of the populations has different markings and colorings. Where would rat snakes most likely be gray?
Options: ['in a forest', 'in a swamp', 'in a gravel pit', 'in a corn field']
Answer: in a gravel pit

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "in a gravel pit",
    "reasoning": "Considering the adaptive nature of rat snake populations to their environments, the likeliest color for camouflage in a gravel pit - an area with a lot of grays and neutral tones from the stones and gravel - would be gray. In contrast, forests, swamps, and corn fields would likely demand different colorings and patterns more suited to green, brown, and varied environments."
