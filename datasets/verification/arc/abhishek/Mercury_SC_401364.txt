Question: A drop of red food coloring is added to a bowl of water. Several minutes later, all of the water is red. Which of these describes the change that took place?
Options: ['erosion', 'osmosis', 'diffusion', 'transfusion']

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "diffusion",
    "reasoning": "The process described is diffusion because it involves the movement of particles (red food coloring) from an area of higher concentration (initial drop location) to areas of lower concentration (rest of the water) until uniform distribution is achieved."
