Model Answer: {
    "answer": "incorrect.",
    "reasoning": "While the Internet can indeed provide free, current, and detailed information, which are all beneficial aspects, the primary concern or problem identified with using Internet-based resources is the potential for encountering incorrect information. This is due to the vast amount of data available online, not all of which is verified or peer-reviewed, making it crucial for students to critically evaluate the credibility of their sources. Therefore, the challenge lies in discerning accurate information from inaccuracies, which is why 'incorrect.' is identified as the potential problem in the context of the question."
