Question: Which statement is true about the particles of a liquid compared to the particles of a gas?
Options: ['Particles of a liquid are a slower and further apart.', 'Particles of a liquid are faster and farther apart.', 'Particles of a liquid are slower and closer together.', 'Particles of a liquid are faster and closer together.']
Answer: Particles of a liquid are slower and closer together.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Particles of a liquid are slower and closer together.",
    "reasoning": "This option correctly reflects the fact that particles in a liquid state are generally moving more slowly due to close proximity, which is a result of intermolecular forces being stronger than in gases. This leads to liquids having a definite volume but not a definite shape, contrasting with gases, where particles move more rapidly and are farther apart, filling the volume of their container."
