Model Answer: {
    "answer": "egg",
    "reasoning": "Based on the life cycle of a butterfly, the sequence begins with the 'egg' stage, where it is laid by the adult butterfly. This is followed by the 'caterpillar' stage, where the egg hatches into a larva (caterpillar), which then becomes a 'pupa' (chrysalis) before finally transforming into the 'adult' butterfly. The option 'egg' is the first stage in the life cycle sequence, making it the correct answer."
