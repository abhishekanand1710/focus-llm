    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "melting and evaporation",
    "reasoning": "In the context of the water cycle, both melting and evaporation are processes that require energy absorption. Melting requires energy for the phase change from solid (ice) to liquid water. Similarly, evaporation needs energy to transition water from a liquid to a gaseous state. These processes are essential parts of the water cycle where energy absorption is necessary to change the phase of water."
