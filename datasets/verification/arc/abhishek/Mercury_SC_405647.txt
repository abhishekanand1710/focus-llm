Question: The ice cubes in a freezer are melting. Which change most likely is causing the ice cubes to melt?
Options: ['a decrease in the mass of the ice cubes', 'an increase in the mass of the ice cubes', 'a decrease in the temperature inside the freezer', 'an increase in the temperature inside the freezer']
Answer: an increase in the temperature inside the freezer

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "an increase in the temperature inside the freezer",
    "reasoning": "The melting of ice cubes is directly caused by an increase in temperature. Since freezers are designed to maintain temperatures below the freezing point of water, any malfunction or adjustment resulting in the temperature rising above this point would lead to the melting of ice cubes. The mass of the ice cubes is a result of melting, not a cause, and a decrease in freezer temperature would further solidify ice, not melt it."
