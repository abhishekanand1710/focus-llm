Question: People may remove fallen trees from forests to reduce fire risk. Removing the trees is now thought to have an impact on the health of the forest. Which impact would removing fallen trees from forests most likely have on forest health?
Options: ['increased risk of forest fire', 'increased food sources for forest fungi', 'decreased soil fertility by preventing nutrient recycling', 'decreased forest vegetation by increasing sunlight penetration']
Answer: decreased soil fertility by preventing nutrient recycling

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "decreased soil fertility by preventing nutrient recycling",
    "reasoning": "Removing fallen trees from forests interrupts the process of nutrient recycling, as these trees decompose and contribute essential nutrients back into the soil. This disruption of nutrient recycling can lead to decreased soil fertility, as the soil becomes less rich in the nutrients necessary for other plants and trees to thrive. This supports the maintenance of forest health by retaining soil quality, which in turn supports diverse plant life and a balanced ecosystem. The relationships illustrated between fallen trees, nutrient recycling, and soil fertility demonstrate the critical role that fallen trees play in maintaining the health and sustainability of forest ecosystems."
