Question: Scientists found a fossil of an elephant in the African savanna. It has much longer tusks and is much larger than elephant species presently inhabiting the area. This elephant fossil most likely reveals
Options: ['the diet of early elephants.', 'that elephants travel in herds.', 'the function of the trunk of the elephant.', 'that physical changes occurred in elephants over time.']
Answer: that physical changes occurred in elephants over time.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "that physical changes occurred in elephants over time.",
    "reasoning": "The discovery of an elephant fossil with much longer tusks and a larger size than current elephants in the African savanna suggests that significant physical changes occurred in elephants over time. This change could be attributed to evolution, which is supported by the relationship between fossils indicating physical changes and evolution being the process underlying these changes."
