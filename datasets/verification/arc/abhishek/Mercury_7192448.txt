Key: Mercury_7192448

Question: Forests have been cut and burned so that the land can be used to raise crops. Which consequence does this activity have on the atmosphere of Earth?
Options: ['It reduces the amount of carbon dioxide production.', 'It reduces the production of oxygen.', 'It decreases the greenhouse effect.', 'It decreases pollutants in the air.']
Answer: It reduces the production of oxygen.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It reduces the production of oxygen.",
    "reasoning": "Deforestation leads to the cutting down and removal of trees, which are a primary source of oxygen production through the process of photosynthesis. By reducing the number of trees, deforestation directly results in a decrease in the production of oxygen, making it the consequence of such activity on the atmosphere of Earth."
