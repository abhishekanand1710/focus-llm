Question: The liver converts glucose to glycogen for storage. Why is this function considered a chemical change?
Options: ['because the conversion transforms solids to liquids', 'because the conversion allows for less glucose in the liver', 'because the conversion changes one substance to a new one', 'because the conversion changes the shape of the liver cells']
Answer: because the conversion changes one substance to a new one

        "description": "This conversion is a chemical change because it results in the formation of a new substance."
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "because the conversion changes one substance to a new one",
    "reasoning": "The conversion of glucose to glycogen by the liver is considered a chemical change because it results in the formation of a new substance, glycogen, from glucose. This process fundamentally alters the chemical composition of the substance involved, which aligns with the definition of a chemical change."
