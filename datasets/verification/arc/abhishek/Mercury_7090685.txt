Model Answer: {
    "answer": "water treatment.",
    "reasoning": "Given the limited resources scenario, the country would most likely focus on technologies that have immediate and impactful benefits to its citizens' well-being and survival. Among the options, water treatment directly addresses the basic need for clean and safe drinking water, making it a priority. Technologies like space exploration, robotic automation, and satellite communications, while valuable, do not directly address immediate basic needs and typically require more substantial resources that a country with limited resources might not prioritize."
