    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "loss of habitat for animals",
    "reasoning": "Cutting down large numbers of trees directly impacts their role as providers of habitat. This activity destroys the natural environment in which many species live and grow, leading to a loss of biodiversity. While trees also contribute to oxygen production, carbon sequestration, and soil stability, their role in providing habitat is immediate and crucial for the survival of animal species that depend on forests and woodlands. Therefore, the most likely effect of cutting down large numbers of trees is the loss of habitat for animals, as indicated by the relationship between trees providing habitat and the requirements of numerous species for survival."
