    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "chemical",
    "reasoning": "Fossil fuels contain high amounts of chemical energy that is released during combustion processes. This energy originates from the chemical bonds formed from ancient biological material. Unlike mechanical, nuclear, or radiant energy, chemical energy is inherent in the molecular structure of fossil fuels, making it the correct answer."
