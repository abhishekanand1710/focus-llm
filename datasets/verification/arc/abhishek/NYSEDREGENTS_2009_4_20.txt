Model Answer: {
    "answer": "claws for obtaining food",
    "reasoning": "Of the options provided, only the pairing of 'claws for obtaining food' accurately represents the function of a bird's structure with its purpose. Claws are indeed used by many bird species to catch and hold onto their prey, making it essential for their ability to obtain food. The other options contain incorrect pairings of bird structures with functions that do not match real-world biology (e.g., wings are not used for eliminating waste, feathers are not for breathing, and eyes do not facilitate growing). This understanding is based on the typical biological functions of these bird structures."
