Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Earth to orbit around the Sun.",
    "reasoning": "It takes approximately 365 days for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun, aligning with the period known as a year. This fact is supported by our understanding of the solar system's structure, where planets, including Earth, orbit the Sun due to gravitational forces."
