Model Answer: {
    "answer": "'1 kg subjected to a force of 100 N'",
    "reasoning": "Using Newton's Second Law (Force = Mass x Acceleration), the acceleration of an object can be calculated by dividing the force exerted on the object by its mass. Comparing the provided options, the 1 kg mass subjected to a force of 100 N will undergo the greatest amount of acceleration since the same force is applied to less mass compared to the 100 kg options, and a significantly greater force is applied compared to the 1 kg mass with only 1 N of force. The larger the force applied to a given mass, the greater the acceleration, making the 1 kg mass with 100 N of force experience the greatest acceleration."
