Question: Jennifer and Mark prepared a layer cake using oil and water. After the cake baked in the oven, they added frosting. Which property could be measured with a balance?
Options: ['the temperature of the oven', 'the mass of the frosting', 'the height of the layers', 'the volume of the oil']
Answer: the mass of the frosting

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the mass of the frosting",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, only the mass of the frosting can be directly measured with a balance. A balance is a tool specifically designed to measure the mass of objects. The other options involve measurements (temperature, height, volume) that are not related to the mass and therefore require different tools for their measurement, such as thermometers, rulers, or measuring cups for temperature, height, and volume respectively."
