Question: The human body produces motion by changing chemical energy into mechanical energy. Which of these best describes what happens to the energy?
Options: ['The total amount of energy increases.', 'The total amount of energy is constant.', 'The energy is destroyed through motion.', 'The amount of chemical energy increases.']
Answer: The total amount of energy is constant.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The total amount of energy is constant.",
    "reasoning": "Based on the principle of conservation of energy, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In the context of the human body converting chemical energy into mechanical energy for motion, the total amount of energy remains constant throughout this process."
