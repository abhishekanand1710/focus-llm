Question: A combination of processes occurs when stars are forming. Which is one process most likely associated with the formation of new stars?
Options: ['Hydrogen in the cores of the stars is exhausted.', 'Material accumulates from stars that have died.', 'Elements in the stars such as iron undergo fusion.', 'Cores of stars become twice as massive as the Sun.']
Answer: Material accumulates from stars that have died.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Material accumulates from stars that have died.",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is derived from understanding that star formation is heavily influenced by the accumulation of material, which includes gas, dust, and remnants from stars that have previously died. This material accumulation is essential for the formation of new stars as it provides the necessary matter for the process of gravitational collapse, leading to nuclear fusion and the birth of a new star. The other options either describe processes that happen at later stages in a star's life (hydrogen exhaustion, nuclear fusion of iron) or relate to specific characteristics that are not directly tied to the initial formation process (stellar mass increase)."
