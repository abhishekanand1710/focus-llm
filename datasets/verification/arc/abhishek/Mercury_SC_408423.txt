Question: Marni runs 1500 meters around the school track. What does she need to know in order to find out her speed?
Options: ['her time from start to finish', 'the number of steps she took', 'her heart rate at the finish line', 'the direction she began running']
Answer: her time from start to finish

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "her time from start to finish",
    "reasoning": "To calculate speed, the distance covered and the time taken to cover that distance are essential. Since the distance (1500 meters) is already known, the only other piece of information needed is the time from start to finish. The number of steps taken, heart rate at the finish line, and the direction she began running do not directly affect the calculation of speed."
