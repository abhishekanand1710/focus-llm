    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "mechanical",
    "reasoning": "When a baby shakes a rattle, the physical action or effort put into the shaking is an example of mechanical energy being used. This mechanical energy is then converted into sound energy as the rattle makes noise. This transformation is a process where the movement and energy involved in the act of shaking are directly responsible for the generation of sound."
