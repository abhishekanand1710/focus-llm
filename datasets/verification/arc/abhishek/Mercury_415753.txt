Question: Which of these factors affects how fast a sound wave moves?
Options: ['the kind of material it is moving through', "the amplitude of the sound wave's vibrations", 'the wavelength of the disturbance in the medium', 'the type of motion that caused the sound wave to form']
Answer: the kind of material it is moving through

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the kind of material it is moving through",
    "reasoning": "Out of the provided options, the speed of a sound wave is directly affected by the kind of material it is moving through. Sound waves travel at different speeds in different materials due to the material's density and elasticity, which affect how the particles of the material transfer the vibration of the sound wave. The other options, such as the amplitude, wavelength, and the type of motion that caused the sound wave, influence other characteristics of the sound but not its speed."
