Model Answer: {
    "answer": "lighting a match",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, 'lighting a match' is an example of a chemical change because it involves a reaction that transforms the substances in the match head into new substances (such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and smoke) through the process of combustion. The other options (sugar dissolving in water, water evaporating in air, freezing water) represent physical changes, where the substance remains chemically the same but changes its state or form."
