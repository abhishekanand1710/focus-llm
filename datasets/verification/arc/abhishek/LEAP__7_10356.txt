Question: What do scientists mean when they refer to a population?
Options: ['all the organisms in an ecosystem', 'all the species that share similar anatomical features', 'all the animals that acquire resources through similar methods', 'all the interbreeding members of a certain species in an ecosystem']
Answer: all the interbreeding members of a certain species in an ecosystem

        "relationship": "comprises",
        "related_concept": "interbreeding members of a certain species",
        "description": "A population is specifically made up of the interbreeding members of a species within an area"
    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "all the interbreeding members of a certain species in an ecosystem",
    "reasoning": "Based on the defined concepts and their relationships, a population refers specifically to the group of organisms that are capable of interbreeding (shared gene pool) within a certain species. Furthermore, this group resides within the same ecosystem, distinguishing the concept from broader definitions such as all organisms in an ecosystem or all species with similar anatomical features. The defining factor of a population involves both the capability of interbreeding and belonging to the same species, narrowing down the eligible option to 'all the interbreeding members of a certain species in an ecosystem'."
