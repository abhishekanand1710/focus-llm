    },

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "40 m/s north",
    "reasoning": "The correct representation of the velocity of a moving object must include both a magnitude (speed) and a direction, as velocity is a vector quantity. '40 m/s north' provides both the speed ('40 m/s') and the direction ('north'), aligning with the definition of velocity, where speed is quantified in meters per second and direction indicated by a cardinal point."
