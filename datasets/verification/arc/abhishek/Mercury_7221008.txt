Question: Doctors have determined that each of these factors could cause heart disease in humans except
Options: ['genes that code for heart defects.', 'infections that damage the heart muscle.', 'other diseases that cause the heart to wear out.', 'intense exercise that increases the heart rate.']
Answer: intense exercise that increases the heart rate.

        "description": "In contrast to the other factors, intense exercise is generally not a direct cause of heart disease and is often beneficial."
    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "intense exercise that increases the heart rate",
    "reasoning": "While genes, infections, and other diseases directly contribute to the development of heart disease by causing defects, damage, or excessive strain to the heart, intense exercise typically benefits heart health by strengthening it and improving circulation. It is not considered a direct cause of heart disease and instead often plays a positive role in preventing heart-related issues."
