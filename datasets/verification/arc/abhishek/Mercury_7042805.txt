Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ruler",
    "reasoning": "The ruler is the most appropriate tool among the options to calculate the volume of a glass prism. By measuring the dimensions (length, width, height) of the prism with a ruler, one can use these measurements to calculate its volume. Scales, voltmeters, and thermometers do not provide the necessary measurements for calculating volume, as they measure weight, electric potential difference, and temperature, respectively."
