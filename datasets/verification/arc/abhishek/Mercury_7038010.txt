Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Keep work area dry.",
    "reasoning": "Of the given options, 'Keep work area dry' is directly related to preventing the primary risk associated with electrical devices: electrical shock. Water is a conductor of electricity, and its presence increases the risk of electric shock. Therefore, keeping the work area dry is an essential safety measure when using electrical devices, aligning with the practices of electrical device safety."
