Model Answer: {
    "answer": "nitrate levels and turbidity",
    "reasoning": "Nitrate levels and turbidity directly affect water quality and aquatic life, leading to significant ecological impacts. High nitrate levels can result in eutrophication, reducing oxygen levels crucial for aquatic organisms, while turbidity influences water clarity, affecting photosynthesis and habitat. These factors have a direct and often immediate impact on the health of river systems, more so than the other options provided."
