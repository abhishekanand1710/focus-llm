Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Hail during a storm",
    "reasoning": "Hail during a storm best describes water in a solid state. It is precipitation that comes down as balls or irregular lumps of ice, contrasting with the other options, such as vapor, waves, and rain, which represent water in its gaseous and liquid states."
