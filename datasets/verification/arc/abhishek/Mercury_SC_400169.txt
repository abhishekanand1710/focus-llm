Model Answer: {
    "answer": "manufactured artificial stones that resemble diamonds.",
    "reasoning": "The advertisement is for 'Simu-Gems,' which are described as 'as shiny as diamonds at a fraction of the price,' indicating they are not natural diamonds but rather artificial stones created to resemble diamonds. This aligns with the option that they are 'manufactured artificial stones that resemble diamonds,' as the description of being like diamonds but cheaper implies an artificial alternative rather than genuine, naturally mined diamonds."
