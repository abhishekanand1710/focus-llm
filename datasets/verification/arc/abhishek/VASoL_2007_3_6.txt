]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "leave the land alone",
    "reasoning": "The health and functionality of wetland habitats are essential for supporting the birds and fish that rely on these ecosystems. By leaving the land alone, we avoid disrupting or destroying the unique conditions that these species need to thrive. Altering the land by draining water, flooding, or converting it for agricultural use directly impacts the habitat negatively. Thus, to continue supporting bird and fish populations, minimal human interference, such as not altering the natural state of the wetlands, is the best option."
