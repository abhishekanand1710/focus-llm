Question: Paul observes four different samples of water. He records the temperature and volume of each sample. Which of his samples contains the greatest amount of thermal energy?
Options: ['100 mL of 10°C water', '100 mL of 25°C water', '5 liters of 10°C water', '5 liters of 25°C water']
Answer: 5 liters of 25°C water

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "5 liters of 25\u00b0C water",
    "reasoning": "Both the volume and temperature of the water influence its thermal energy. The 5 liters of 25\u00b0C water has both the highest volume and the highest temperature among the options, meaning it contains the most particles with the highest average kinetic energy, thereby possessing the greatest amount of thermal energy."
