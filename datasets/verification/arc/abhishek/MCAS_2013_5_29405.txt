Model Answer: {
    "answer": "It stays in one shape.",
    "reasoning": "When orange juice is frozen, it undergoes a phase change from a liquid to a solid. This phase change allows the previously fluid orange juice to maintain a fixed shape, unlike its liquid form which could flow and take the shape of its container. Freezing does not increase its mass or reduce its volume significantly; therefore, the best description of how orange juice changes when frozen is that it stays in one shape."
