Key: Mercury_7161228

Question: Evidence indicates that the magnetic field of Earth has reversed direction many times throughout history. After a magnetic reversal, which would most likely be affected?
Options: ['the length and severity of seasons', 'the formation of new tectonic plates', 'the direction of rotation of Earth on the axis', 'the alignment of minerals in newly formed crust']
Answer: the alignment of minerals in newly formed crust

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "the alignment of minerals in newly formed crust",
    "reasoning": "The alignment of minerals in newly formed crust is directly influenced by the Earth's magnetic field. Therefore, when a magnetic reversal occurs, causing the Earth's magnetic field to change direction, the orientation of mineral grains in solidifying volcanic rocks would likely be affected. This relationship highlights that while magnetic reversals do not influence the Earth's rotation, the formation of tectonic plates, or the seasonal weather patterns, they do impact how minerals align in the newly formed crust."
