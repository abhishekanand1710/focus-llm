Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Protists and Plants",
    "reasoning": "The organism in question is multicellular, autotrophic, and does not move on its own. This description fits organisms in the Plant kingdom, which are known for being multicellular, autotrophic (capable of photosynthesis), and stationary. Some Protists also fit this description since the Protist kingdom includes organisms that are both multicellular and autotrophic, though they often vary significantly in other characteristics. Fungi and Animals are not primarily autotrophic; fungi are heterotrophic organisms that absorb nutrients from their environment, and animals consume other organisms for energy."
