Key: TIMSS_1995_8_O11

Question: Which is a chemical change?
Options: ['Element 1 is hammered into a thin sheet.', 'Element 2 is heated and turns into a liquid.', 'Element 3 turns a greenish color as it sits in air.', 'Element 4 is ground up into a fine, slippery powder.']
Answer: Element 3 turns a greenish color as it sits in air.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "Element 3 turns a greenish color as it sits in air.",
    "reasoning": "This option describes oxidation, where the element reacts with oxygen in the air, changing its color due to a chemical change. Unlike hammering into a thin sheet (malleability), heating into a liquid (melting), or grinding into a powder (physical change), this process results in a new substance due to the chemical reaction with the air, making it a chemical change."
