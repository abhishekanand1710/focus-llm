Question: Which describes the role of sexual reproduction in plants and animals?
Options: ['keeps all organisms looking similar', 'ensures the continuation of the species', 'produces offspring that are identical to the parents', 'increases the size of any population over a long period of time']
Answer: ensures the continuation of the species

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "ensures the continuation of the species",
    "reasoning": "Sexual reproduction results in offspring variability and increases genetic diversity, which in turn supports species continuity by enhancing the species' adaptability and survival in changing environments. While it also contributes to population growth, increasing genetic diversity and ensuring adaptability are fundamental to the ongoing survival of a species."
