Model Answer: {
    "answer": "harvesting wood by selective cutting",
    "reasoning": "Among the given options, harvesting wood by selective cutting has the least effect on the lithosphere. This is because it involves the minimal disturbance to the ground and the surrounding environment, as trees are selectively cut down rather than clear-cutting or extensive mining or drilling activities. The selective nature of this method ensures that the impact on the lithosphere is minimal, preserving soil structure and reducing erosion compared to other methods listed."
