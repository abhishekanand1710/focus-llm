Model Answer: {
    "answer": "water",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, water is the only substance that should be used to flush the skin if it gets splashed with an acid. It is important to use large amounts of water to wash away the acid and reduce the risk of burns or damage to the skin. Vinegar, salt, and formaldehyde are not suitable for treating acid splashes due to their properties or potential to worsen the situation."
