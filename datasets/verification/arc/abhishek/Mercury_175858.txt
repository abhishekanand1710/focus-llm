        "description": "A gas that is a reactant in the process of cellular respiration."
    },
    {
        "name": "Heat",
        "description": "A form of energy that is produced as a by-product in many biochemical reactions, including cellular respiration."
    },
    {
        "name": "Sugar",
        "description": "Organic molecules, such as glucose, used as a primary reactant or substrate in cellular respiration."
    },
    {
        "name": "Protein",
        "description": "Large biomolecules, or macromolecules, composed of one or more long chains of amino acid residues which are not a direct by-product of cellular respiration."

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "heat",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, heat is the only correct by-product of cellular respiration in animals. Oxygen is consumed, and not produced, during cellular respiration. Sugar is also consumed as a substrate to produce energy, while protein is not a by-product of this process. Instead, cellular respiration generates heat as part of its energy conversion process."
