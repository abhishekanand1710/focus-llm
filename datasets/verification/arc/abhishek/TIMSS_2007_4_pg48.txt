Model Answer: {
    "answer": "from the food he ate",
    "reasoning": "The energy required for the healing process comes from the food a person eats. This is because food contains nutrients that the body converts into energy, which it then uses for various functions including healing. Bandages and antiseptic creams may support the healing process by preventing infection and protecting the wound, but they do not provide energy. Similarly, while water is vital for health and supports bodily functions, it is not a direct source of energy for healing."
