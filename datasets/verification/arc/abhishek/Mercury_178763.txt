Model Answer: {
    "answer": "heating the soup",
    "reasoning": "Convection is the process of heat transfer through the movement of a fluid, which in this case is the liquid soup. As the soup is heated by the pan, the heat is distributed throughout the soup through the movement of its liquid particles, demonstrating convection. Other options such as heating the pan, heating the spoon, and heating the stove burner involve processes that primarily rely on conduction and energy conversion rather than the movement of fluid for heat transfer."
