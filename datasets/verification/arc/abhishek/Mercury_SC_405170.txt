Question: Two balls rolled down two identical inclined planes. The balls were exactly the same mass and size, but one ball rolled down the inclined plane faster. Identify a possible reason that one ball rolled faster than the other ball.
Options: ['One ball was red and the other ball was blue.', 'One ball was new and the other ball was old.', 'One ball was shiny and the other ball was dull.', 'One ball was sticky and the other ball was smooth.']
Answer: One ball was sticky and the other ball was smooth.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "One ball was sticky and the other ball was smooth.",
    "reasoning": "The difference in rolling speeds can be attributed to the difference in surface textures between the two balls. A smooth ball has lower friction when rolling down an inclined plane, allowing it to move faster than a sticky ball, which would experience higher friction and thus roll down the plane slower. This is because the surface texture affects friction, which in turn influences the velocity of the balls. The other options (color, age, or shininess) are less relevant to the physics of motion and friction."
