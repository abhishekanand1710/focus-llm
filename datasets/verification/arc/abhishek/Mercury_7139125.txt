Options: ['coarse soil', 'low latitude', 'lack of clouds', 'high altitude']
Answer: lack of clouds

    {
        "name": "coarse soil",
        "description": "Soil composed of relatively large particles, influencing its ability to retain heat."
    },
    {

        "description": "Absence or minimal presence of clouds in the sky, affecting temperature regulation."
    },
    {
        "name": "high altitude",
        "description": "Elevated areas above sea level, generally experiencing cooler temperatures."

        "relationship": "leads to",
        "related_concept": "cooler temperatures",
        "description": "Elevated areas generally experience cooler temperatures due to the decrease in air pressure and temperature with altitude."
    }

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "lack of clouds",
    "reasoning": "The main reason for low nighttime temperatures in the Sahara Desert is the 'lack of clouds.' Clouds act as a blanket and help to trap heat in the atmosphere during the night. In the absence of clouds, any heat received during the day is quickly lost to space, leading to a significant drop in temperature at night. While factors like coarse soil, low latitude, and even high altitude can influence temperature variations, the dramatic decrease in nighttime temperatures in deserts is primarily due to the lack of cloud cover."
