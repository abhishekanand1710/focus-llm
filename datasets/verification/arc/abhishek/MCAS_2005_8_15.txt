Question: Sulfur (S), oxygen (O2), water (H2O), and sodium chloride (NaCl) are all examples of pure substances. Which of the following describes all pure substances?
Options: ['A pure substance consists of only one type of element.', 'A pure substance has a definite chemical composition.', 'A pure substance cannot be broken down into simpler substances.', 'A pure substance is normally found as a solid at room temperature.']
Answer: A pure substance has a definite chemical composition.

    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "A pure substance has a definite chemical composition.",
    "reasoning": "The definition that encapsulates all the provided examples of pure substances (Sulfur, Oxygen, Water, Sodium chloride) is that they all have a definite and constant chemical composition. Elements consist of one type of atom, and compounds are made up of atoms of different elements in definite proportions, emphasizing the core characteristic of pure substances having a specific and unvarying chemical composition."
