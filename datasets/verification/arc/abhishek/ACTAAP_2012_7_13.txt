    }
]

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "table salt",
    "reasoning": "Table salt is identified as a compound because it is composed of sodium and chlorine, which combines to form sodium chloride (NaCl). This makes it the only option listed that is a combination of two or more elements chemically combined in a fixed ratio, satisfying the criteria of a compound."
