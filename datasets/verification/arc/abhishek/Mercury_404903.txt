Question: If a child scrapes his foot on a piece of rusty metal, it is important to get medical treatment because the
Options: ['metal is corrosive to the skin.', 'foot carries large amounts of bacteria.', 'foot is the most sensitive part of the body.', 'metal may be contaminated and cause infection.']

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "metal may be contaminated and cause infection.",
    "reasoning": "The correct answer is chosen based on the relationship between 'rusty metal' and 'infection', highlighting that rusty metal can carry bacteria which may cause infections if it enters the skin through a scrape or cut. This is a more precise and relevant concern compared to the other options, as the nature of the metal being 'corrosive' and the general sensitivity or bacterial load of the foot doesn't directly relate to the urgent medical risk posed by a potential infection from a contaminated object."
