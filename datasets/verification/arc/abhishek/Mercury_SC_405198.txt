Model Answer: {
    "answer": "more days of rain showers",
    "reasoning": "Among the options provided, 'more days of rain showers' is the factor most likely to increase plant populations. This is because rain provides water, which is a basic and essential need for plant growth. In contrast, strong winds and freezing temperatures can damage or kill plants, and fewer days of sunshine can limit photosynthesis, which is critical for plant growth and survival. Therefore, increased rainfall directly supports plant health and population growth."
