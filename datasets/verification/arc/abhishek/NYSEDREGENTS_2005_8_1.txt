Question: Which statement best explains why the Sun and the Moon appear to be about the same size in the sky?
Options: ['The Sun and the Moon have the same diameter.', 'The Moon is larger in diameter and farther from Earth than the Sun.', 'The Moon is smaller in diameter and is closer to Earth than the Sun.', 'The Sun and the Moon are the same distance from Earth.']
Answer: The Moon is smaller in diameter and is closer to Earth than the Sun.

Model Answer: {
    "answer": "The Moon is smaller in diameter and is closer to Earth than the Sun.",
    "reasoning": "Although the Sun's diameter is much larger than the Moon's, the Sun is also significantly farther from Earth. The combination of these two factors - the Moon's smaller size but much closer proximity to Earth compared to the Sun - results in the Sun and the Moon appearing to be about the same size in the sky."
