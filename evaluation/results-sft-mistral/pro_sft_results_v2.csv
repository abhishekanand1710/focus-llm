[your answer]
{
  ""answer"": ""laborer"",
  ""reasoning"": ""The sentence structure implies that the laborer was referred to the designer because the laborer herself is
the best, indicating that 'she' refers to the laborer. This is supported by the relationships identified, where the laborer
is both the subject of the action ('was referred to') and the subject of the qualifier ('is the best').""
