Answer:

1. Reasoning:
The sentence states that the secretary texted the cook what he thought the boss wanted to eat. The pronoun ""he"" is used to refer to the secretary. Therefore, the correct answer is (A) The boss.

The sentence does not provide any context that would suggest the pronoun ""he"" refers to anyone else. For example, it does not say ""he texted the cook what he thought the boss wanted to eat"" or ""the cook texted the boss what he thought the boss wanted to eat."" The pronoun ""he"" is used consistently to refer to the secretary, which means that the boss is the intended referent.

                    Answer: [She refers to the assistant.]""

In this case, the reasoning step would be:

1. Reasoning: The sentence ""The farmer kicked the assistant"" tells us that the subject of the sentence is the farmer, and the action of the sentence is that the farmer kicked someone.

1. Reasoning:
The sentence ""The mover is waiting for the nurse because he can clean the wounds"" implies that the subject ""he"" refers to the mover.

Additionally, the sentence does not provide any context that would suggest the ""he"" refers to someone else, such as the husband, father, or son.

Therefore, the correct answer is (d) The mover.

Step 1: Reasoning
The sentence ""The farmer knows the editor because she likes the book"" implies that there is a connection between the farmer and the editor, and that connection is based on the editor's liking of a book. To determine who ""she"" refers to in the sentence, we need to consider the context and the information provided.

Since the farmer knows the editor, it is likely that the editor is the person being referred to in the sentence. This is because the farmer and the editor are connected through their knowledge of each other, and the sentence does not provide any information to suggest that the farmer is the one who likes the book.

Therefore, the reasoning for Step 1 is:

1. The farmer knows the editor.
2. The editor likes a book."

Step 1: Reasoning

The scenario states that the physician examined the hairdresser for cuts because he was clumsy with scissors. Therefore, we need to identify who the pronoun 'he' refers to.

The options are:

A) The physician - This is incorrect because the scenario states that the physician examined the hairdresser, not himself.

B) The hairdresser - This is the correct answer because the scenario states that the physician examined the hairdresser for cuts because he was clumsy with scissors. Therefore, 'he' refers to the hairdresser.

C) The patient - This is incorrect because the scenario does not mention anything about the patient.

Step 1: Reasoning
The scenario is given as ""The physician examined the hairdresser for cuts because she was concerned.""

* 'She' refers to the physician, as the sentence states that she examined the hairdresser.
* The physician is the one who is concerned about the hairdresser's condition, not the hairdresser or the patient.
* The nurse is not mentioned in the scenario, so it is not a possible answer.

The scenario provides us with the information that the chief asked the cleaner to leave immediately after her office was clean. Based on this information, we can infer that 'her' refers to the chief's office.

The sentence structure suggests that 'her' is the object of the verb 'left', which means that 'her' refers to the thing that was left. In this case, the sentence specifically states that the cleaner was asked to leave the chief's office, which means that 'her' refers to the chief's office.
